# Twilight Imperium IV - Community Terminology & Glossary

This guide explains community shorthand and terminology used throughout the faction guides that doesn't appear in the official rulebook. If you've read the rules but find yourself confused by certain terms in the guides, this reference is for you.

## Shorthand Notation

### Tech Prerequisites

Technologies show prerequisite requirements using letter codes representing colors:

- **B** = Blue technology
- **R** = Red technology
- **Y** = Yellow technology
- **G** = Green technology

**Multiple Prerequisites:**
- **BB** = 2 Blue techs required (e.g., "Carrier II (BB)")
- **RR** = 2 Red techs required (e.g., "Duranium Armor (RR)")
- **GG** = 2 Green techs required (e.g., "Infantry II (GG)")
- **YY** = 2 Yellow techs required (e.g., "Space Dock II (YY)")

**Mixed Prerequisites:**
- **GYR** = 1 Green + 1 Yellow + 1 Red required (e.g., "Cruiser II (GYR)")
- **BBY** = 2 Blue + 1 Yellow required (e.g., "Dreadnought II (BBY)")
- **RRRY** = 3 Red + 1 Yellow required (e.g., "War Sun (RRRY)")

**Breakthrough Synergy Notation:**
- **B<>R** = Blue and Red count as each other for prerequisites
- **R<>Y** = Red and Yellow count as each other
- **Y<>G** = Yellow and Green count as each other

### Round Abbreviations

- **R1** = Round 1
- **R2** = Round 2
- **R3-4** = Rounds 3 through 4
- **R5+** = Round 5 and beyond

Examples: "Research this tech R2-3" means "research this technology during rounds 2 or 3."

### Common Abbreviations

- **MR** = Mecatol Rex (the central system)
- **PN** = Promissory Note
- **TG** = Trade Good(s)
- **CC** = Command Counter / Command Token
- **HS** = Home System

## Community Terminology

### Slice

**Definition:** Your section of the galaxy map - the 3-5 systems adjacent to your home system that form your starting territory.

**Usage:** "Rich slice" means good planets with high resources/influence. "Balanced slice" means a mix of resources and influence. "Your slice" refers to the systems you're expected to claim during initial expansion.

**Example:** "Mahact wants resource-heavy slices" means Mahact prefers systems with high resource values in their starting territory.

---

### Plastic

**Definition:** Community slang for units and ships on the game board. Called "plastic" because the physical game pieces are plastic miniatures.

**Usage:** "Building plastic" = producing units. "More plastic on the board" = having more ships and ground forces.

**Example:** "Getting your plastic economy started" means beginning to produce units regularly.

---

### Tech Skip

**Definition:** Community slang for a planet with a technology specialty (the colored icons on some planet cards).

**Usage:** When researching a technology, you may exhaust a planet with a matching technology specialty to ignore one prerequisite of that color.

**Example:** "You need blue tech skips for your tech path" means you want planets with blue technology specialties to help research blue technologies more easily.

**How it works:** A blue tech skip planet lets you research a technology requiring 2 blue prerequisites with only 1 blue tech owned. The specialty "skips" one prerequisite.

---

### Equidistant

**Definition:** Systems positioned between two or more players' home systems, equally accessible to multiple factions. Often contested territory.

**Usage:** These systems are typically high-value and can be claimed by whichever player expands first. Not formally "owned" by any player's slice.

**Example:** "Grab an equidistant planet" means claiming a valuable system between you and a neighbor before they do.

---

### Tech Path

**Definition:** Your planned sequence of technologies to research, designed to efficiently reach your strategic goals.

**Usage:** Paths are designed to unlock prerequisites for key faction technologies or unit upgrades while minimizing wasted research.

**Example:** "Blue tech path" = focusing on blue technologies. "Your tech path is Grav Drive → Carrier II → Fleet Logistics" means that's your planned research order.

---

### Forward Dock / Forward Space Dock

**Definition:** A space dock built on a planet outside your home system, providing production capacity closer to contested areas or Mecatol Rex.

**Usage:** Reduces movement needed for newly built units to reach the front lines.

**Example:** "Build a forward dock on a high-resource planet near Mecatol Rex" means placing a space dock outside your home system for strategic production.

---

### Double Tech

**Definition:** Researching two technologies in a single round.

**How:** Normally accomplished by taking the Technology strategy card (primary ability researches 1 tech, secondary ability lets you spend resources for a 2nd tech). Some factions have abilities that enable easier double-tech.

**Example:** "You can double tech R3 to get Carrier II and Dreadnought II together."

---

### Stalling

**Definition:** Taking non-committal actions to delay your impactful moves, often waiting until other players have passed so they cannot retaliate or stop your important plays.

**Usage:** Players "stall" by taking low-value or defensive actions to preserve their ability to make critical moves after opponents have used up their actions and passed.

**Example:** "Use your strong token economy for stalling in late game" means you can afford to take multiple small actions while waiting for the right moment to make your big play when opponents can't respond.

---

### Win-Slaying

**Definition:** The final-round aggressive moves needed to secure victory points and prevent opponents from winning. The critical end-game push.

**Usage:** Typically refers to Round 5-6 plays like taking Mecatol Rex, stealing key planets, or blocking the leader from scoring objectives.

**Example:** "Your hero is perfect for win-slaying" means the hero ability is ideal for decisive end-game plays.

---

### Optimal Resources / Optimal Influence

**Definition:** A calculation method for evaluating planet value when planets have both resources and influence.

**How to Calculate:**
- A planet with **2 resources / 0 influence** = **2 optimal resources, 0 optimal influence**
- A planet with **1 resource / 1 influence** = **0.5 optimal resources, 0.5 optimal influence**

**Why:** Since you can only use resources OR influence from a planet at any given time (not both), planets with split values have half the effective value in each category.

**Example:** "Your home system has 3 resources / 5 influence (0 optimal resources / 5 optimal influence)" means if you always spend influence, you get the full 5 value. The 3 resources go unused, so they don't count as "optimal."

**Usage in Guides:** Helps evaluate the true economic strength of mixed-value planets versus specialized planets.

## Strategic Concepts

### Component Action

**Definition:** An action granted by a game component such as an action card, technology, leader ability, or faction ability. These are distinct from tactical actions (activating systems) and strategic actions (using strategy cards).

**Examples:**
- Action cards with "ACTION:" written on them (e.g., "ACTION: Spend 4 trade goods to research 1 technology")
- Technologies with action abilities (e.g., Sling Relay: "ACTION: Exhaust this card to produce 1 ship...")
- Agent abilities (usually "ACTION: Exhaust this agent to...")
- Hero abilities (one-time component actions that purge after use)
- Faction abilities with "ACTION:" listed

**Usage:** Component actions count as your action for the turn during the action phase. Some faction abilities trigger "after you perform a component action."

**Example:** "Council Keleres commander triggers after component actions" means abilities like using your agent or playing an action card will activate the commander ability.

---

### Expansion

**Definition:** The early-game priority (Rounds 1-2) of using your starting fleet to claim as many systems and planets as possible.

**Goal:** Establish your economic base of resources and influence for future production and strategy. Good expansion typically means controlling 3-4 systems by end of Round 1.

---

### Speaker Order

**Definition:** The turn order for selecting strategy cards each round, determined by who holds the speaker token.

**How it works:** The speaker chooses first, followed by players clockwise around the table. Being early in speaker order lets you pick the best strategy cards; being late means choosing from leftovers.

**Changes:** The speaker token changes when someone takes the Politics strategy card.

This glossary covers the most common non-rulebook terminology you'll encounter in the faction guides. Understanding these terms will make the strategic discussions much clearer.
