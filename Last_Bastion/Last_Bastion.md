# The Last Bastion Comprehensive Strategy Guide

## I. Introduction

The Last Bastion are Twilight Imperium's **escalating combat faction**, rewarding sustained warfare through the unique **Galvanize** mechanic. Each combat allows you to galvanize units (placing tokens beneath them that grant +1 die for all combat rolls), creating a snowball effect where your fleet becomes progressively stronger with each engagement. Your Liberate ability readies planets instantly if you invade with infantry equal to the planet's resource value, accelerating economic recovery. You start with a choice of any blue or yellow technology with no prerequisites, control the legendary Ordinian planet (exhaust when passing for action card + command token), and deploy unique Helios space docks that increase planet resources. This faction rewards aggressive expansion, frequent combat to stack galvanize tokens, and leveraging your scaling flagship (+1 combat per planet you control) to dominate late-game.

## II. Playstyle

**Early Game (Rounds 1-2):**
Your opening focuses on selecting your starting technology strategically (Gravity Drive, Fleet Logistics, or Sarween Tools recommended) and leveraging Liberate for rapid expansion. When conquering planets, bring infantry equal to the planet's resource value to ready it immediately, allowing you to produce units the same round. Your Phoenix Standard ability galvanizes 1 unit after each combat, so seek early conflicts (even small skirmishes) to start accumulating galvanize tokens. Your unique Helios space docks increase planet resources by +1, making even 1-resource planets into 2-resource production hubs. Your Ordinian legendary planet provides insurance: exhaust it when passing to gain 1 action card + 1 command token if you need resources late in a round. With only 1 commodity, trade economy is nonexistent—focus on conquest.

**Mid Game (Rounds 3-4):**
This is when galvanize tokens snowball. Your commander (Nip and Tuck) unlocks with only 3 galvanized units on board, granting immunity to Sabotage action cards and Nekro assimilation. Continue seeking combats to galvanize units; each galvanized unit rolls +1 die, making your fleets disproportionately strong. Your flagship (The Egeiro) gains +1 combat for each non-home planet you control, scaling massively with territorial expansion. Build more Helios space docks on conquered planets to increase their resource values further (V2 upgrade grants +2 resources). Your Proxima Targeting faction tech cancels 1 bombardment hit per galvanized ground force, making your invasions highly resistant to bombardment. Research The Icon breakthrough (yellow/red) to produce ships directly in systems with your command tokens and ground forces, enabling rapid reinforcement.

**Late Game (Rounds 5-6+):**
By this stage, you should have 6-10 galvanized units forming an unstoppable armada. Your hero (Entity 4X41A "Apollo") triggers when a galvanized unit dies, rolling dice to destroy ALL enemy units in that system (each die that meets combat value destroys a unit). This creates devastating board clears when your galvanized dreadnoughts or cruisers die. Your flagship with 8-10 planets controlled rolls at combat 17-19 (effectively auto-hitting everything), making it nearly invincible. The Icon breakthrough lets you produce entire fleets in forward positions, bypassing space dock placement. Victory comes from **sustained territorial control**, leveraging galvanize scaling to win combats effortlessly, and scoring combat/territorial objectives.

## III. The Basics

### A. Home System & Commodities

**Ordinian (Home System - Legendary):** 0 resources, 0 influence
- A legendary planet with NO economic value
- **Legendary Ability:** *You may exhaust this card when you pass to draw 1 action card and gain 1 command token*
- Critical insurance mechanism: if you passed early, exhaust for action card + token
- Provides late-round flexibility
- 0/0 means you rely entirely on expansion for economy

**Revelation (Home System - Trade Station):** 1 resource, 2 influence
- Small resource/influence contribution
- Trade Station provides minor economic boost
- 2 influence helps early agenda phases slightly
- Combined with Ordinian, you start with very weak economy

**Commodities:** 1
- THE LOWEST commodity count in the entire game
- Trade economy is completely non-viable
- Other factions won't prioritize trading with you
- Focus entirely on conquest for economic growth

**Optimal Resource/Influence from Home Worlds:**
- Ordinian: 0 optimal resources / 0 optimal influence (legendary ability is the value)
- Revelation: 1 optimal resource / 2 optimal influence
- Total: 1 optimal resource / 2 optimal influence from home
- You DESPERATELY need expansion for any economic viability

### B. Starting Fleet

**1 Dreadnought:**
- Standard dreadnought (cost 4, combat 5, sustain damage, bombardment 5)
- Will become galvanized through Phoenix Standard
- Forms core of early galvanize snowball

**1 Carrier:**
- Standard capacity 6 carrier
- Transports your 3 starting infantry
- Critical for Liberate invasions

**1 Cruiser:**
- Standard cruiser (cost 2, combat 7, move 2)
- Affordable screening unit
- Can be galvanized early for cheap combat boost

**2 Fighters:**
- Standard space combat fodder
- Less important than capital ships for galvanize
- Screen your galvanized units

**3 Infantry:**
- ONLY 3 starting infantry
- Below average for ground forces
- Liberate requires infantry equal to planet resources, so you'll need to produce more

**1 Space Dock (Helios VI):**
- Your unique space dock
- **Increases planet resource value by +1**
- Production +2 (better than standard space dock production +1)
- Already built at your home system

### C. Starting Tech

**Choose ONE Blue or Yellow Technology with No Prerequisites:**

This is your most critical Round 1 decision. Options:

**Blue Technologies:**
- **Antimass Deflectors** - +1 movement capacity; solid but not game-changing
- **Fleet Logistics** - 2 tactical actions per round; EXTREMELY strong for aggressive expansion
- **Gravity Drive** - +1 movement for all ships; excellent mobility boost
- **Scanners** - Movement +1 and look at system contents; niche utility

**Yellow Technologies:**
- **Sarween Tools** - +1 fighter/infantry per production; economic efficiency
- **Graviton Laser System** - +1 die for PDS space cannon; mediocre value
- **Neural Motivator** - +1 command token per status phase; command token sustainability
- **Predictive Intelligence** - Exhaust to cancel action card; situational

**Recommended Choices:**
1. **Fleet Logistics (Blue)** - 2 tactical actions per round is the single most powerful economy/expansion technology
2. **Gravity Drive (Blue)** - Mobility enables aggressive expansion and reaching distant objectives
3. **Sarween Tools (Yellow)** - Economic efficiency for infantry spam (critical for Liberate)

### D. Faction Abilities

**Liberate:**
*When you gain control of a planet, ready that planet if it contains a number of your infantry equal to or greater than that planet's resource value; otherwise, place 1 infantry on that planet.*

- Conquer with infantry ≥ planet resources → planet readies immediately
- Otherwise, gain 1 free infantry on that planet
- Example: 3-resource planet conquered with 3+ infantry → ready immediately, can produce units
- Example: 3-resource planet conquered with 2 infantry → planet exhausted, gain 1 infantry (now 3 total)
- Encourages infantry-heavy invasions
- Readied planets = immediate production capability = snowball expansion
- Plan invasions with enough infantry to trigger ready effect

**Galvanize:**
*When a game effect instructs a player to galvanize a unit, they place a galvanize token beneath it if it does not have one. Galvanized units roll 1 additional die for combat rolls and unit abilities.*

- Galvanized units gain +1 die for combat and unit abilities
- Only 1 galvanize token per unit (cannot stack multiple tokens)
- Applies to space combat, ground combat, bombardment, anti-fighter barrage, space cannon
- Permanent until unit is destroyed
- Your faction abilities, agent, commander, and hero all interact with galvanize
- Galvanize tokens stay even if unit is damaged

**Phoenix Standard:**
*At the end of a combat, you may galvanize 1 of your units that participated.*

- After EVERY combat (space or ground), galvanize 1 participating unit
- You choose which unit to galvanize
- Prioritize high-value units: dreadnoughts, flagship, cruisers (multi-die units benefit less)
- Encourages frequent combat to accumulate galvanize tokens
- Even losing combats lets you galvanize survivors
- Galvanize units that will fight repeatedly

### E. Leaders

**Agent: Dame Briar**
*When a player's unit is destroyed: You may exhaust this card to galvanize another of that player's units in the destroyed unit's system.*

- Exhausts when ANY player's unit is destroyed
- Galvanizes ANOTHER unit belonging to that player in the same system
- Can use on yourself: when your unit dies, galvanize a survivor
- Can use on other players: transaction tool (galvanize their unit for support)
- High value for defensive combats: lose 1 fighter, galvanize your dreadnought
- Moderate transaction value

**Commander: Nip and Tuck**
*Unlock: There are 3 galvanized units on the game board.*
*Your action cards cannot be canceled by "Sabotage" action cards. The Nekro Virus cannot place assimilator tokens on your components.*

- Unlock: 3 galvanized units on board (very easy for Last Bastion)
- **Immunity to Sabotage**: Action cards cannot be canceled by Sabotage
- **Immunity to Nekro Assimilation**: Nekro cannot copy your techs or faction abilities
- Unlocks naturally through Phoenix Standard (galvanize 1 unit per combat)
- Extremely powerful against Nekro and action-card-heavy metagames
- Unlock by Round 2-3 easily

**Hero: Entity 4X41A "Apollo"**
*Unlock: Have 3 scored objectives.*
*Intelligence Unshackled:*
*When one of your galvanized units is destroyed: You may purge this card to roll 1 die for each unit in its system that belongs to another player; if the result is equal to or greater than the galvanized unit's combat value, destroy that unit.*

- Triggers when YOUR galvanized unit is destroyed
- Roll 1 die per ENEMY unit in that system
- Each die result ≥ galvanized unit's combat value = destroy that enemy unit
- Example: Galvanized dreadnought (combat 5) dies; roll 8 dice for 8 enemy units; each 5+ destroys a unit
- Devastating board clear potential
- Best used with high-combat-value galvanized units (dreadnoughts at 5, flagship at 9+)
- Opponent must destroy your galvanized unit to trigger
- Can backfire if unit has low combat value (fighters at 9 require 9+ rolls)

### F. Promissory Note

**Raise the Standard:**
*At the end of a combat: Galvanize 1 of your units that participated. Then, return this card to the Last Bastion player.*

- Grants holder the Phoenix Standard ability for one combat
- Used at end of combat, returns to you
- Moderate transaction value: worth 2-4 trade goods for combat-focused factions
- Can be traded repeatedly after it returns
- Best for factions that want to galvanize key units (Sardakk dreadnoughts, Sol carriers)
- Not game-breaking but useful diplomatic tool

### G. Alliance

**Alliance Ability:**
*While you are neighbors with the Last Bastion player, you gain the following alliance ability:*
*Phoenix Standard - At the end of a combat, you may galvanize 1 of your units that participated.*

- Grants Phoenix Standard ability to an ally
- Neighbor must control or have units in systems adjacent to your units/controlled systems
- Powerful for aggressive factions (Barony, Sardakk, L1Z1X)
- Enables sustained combat scaling for your ally
- High value if traded to a war faction
- Can create powerful 2v1 scenarios where both you and ally galvanize units

### H. Mech

**A3 Valiance:**
*Cost: 2*
*Combat: 6*
*Sustain Damage*
*When this unit is destroyed, if it was galvanized, galvanize up to 3 of your infantry in its system.*

- Standard mech combat 6 with Sustain Damage
- **Triggered ability if galvanized**: When destroyed, galvanize up to 3 infantry in system
- Spreads galvanize tokens to infantry
- Galvanized infantry become combat 9 (instead of combat 8)
- Encourages galvanizing your mechs via Phoenix Standard
- Deploy mechs with infantry groups for defensive synergy
- If mech was NOT galvanized when destroyed, ability doesn't trigger

### I. Flagship

**The Egeiro:**
*Cost: 8*
*Combat: 9 (x1)*
*Move: 1*
*Capacity: 3*
*Sustain Damage*
*Apply +1 to the result of each of this unit's combat rolls for each non-home system that contains a planet you control.*

- Base combat 9
- **+1 combat per non-home planet you control**
- Example: Control 8 non-home planets → flagship combat 17 (auto-hits everything)
- Scales massively with territorial expansion
- Capacity 3 allows ground force transport
- If galvanized, rolls +1 die at combat 9+ (devastating)
- Late-game flagship becomes nearly invincible
- Does NOT count home system planets

### J. Breakthrough

**The Icon (Yellow <> Red):**
*When you produce ships, you may exhaust this card to place those ships in a system that contains 1 of your command tokens, at least 1 of your ground forces, and no other player's ships.*

- Exhaust when producing ships to place them in a forward system
- Target system must have: your command token, at least 1 ground force, no enemy ships
- Bypasses space dock requirement
- Enables producing fleets directly at frontlines
- Does NOT work if enemy ships present (they contest production)
- Requires yellow AND red prerequisites
- Game-changing late-game production flexibility

### K. Slice Considerations

**Critical Priorities:**

1. **High Resources:**
   - You start with 1 resource from home
   - Need 10-15 resources from slice for viability
   - Your Helios space docks increase planet resources (+1 for Helios VI, +2 for Helios V2)
   - Even low-resource planets become valuable with Helios docks

2. **Infantry-Friendly Planets:**
   - Liberate rewards invading with infantry equal to planet resources
   - Lower-resource planets (1-3 resources) easier to Liberate
   - High-resource planets (4-5) require large infantry investments

3. **Influence:**
   - You start with only 2 influence
   - Need influence-rich planets for politics
   - Cultural planets support influence objectives

4. **Technology Specialties:**
   - Industrial (blue) for Fleet Logistics or Carrier upgrades
   - Hazardous (red) for The Icon breakthrough
   - Cybernetic (yellow) for The Icon breakthrough

**Ideal Slice Characteristics:**
- 10-12 resources, 8-10 influence (before Helios bonuses)
- Multiple 1-3 resource planets (easy Liberate targets)
- 1-2 industrial/hazardous technology specialties
- Moderate Mecatol proximity (you'll conquer it with galvanized fleets)

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

**1. Worst Commodity Economy in the Game:**
You have only 1 commodity—the absolute lowest in TI4. Trade strategy card is nearly worthless for you, and other factions won't prioritize trading with you. Economic growth depends entirely on conquest and Helios space dock resource bonuses. You cannot compete economically with trade factions (Hacan, Nomad, Winnu).

**2. Weak Starting Economy:**
With 1/2 from home and 1 commodity, you begin with the weakest economy in the game. Early rounds require aggressive expansion to acquire resources, but you lack the economic foundation to support large fleets or expensive technologies. You'll struggle to fund both fleet production and technology research simultaneously.

**3. Commander Unlock Dependency:**
While unlocking your commander (3 galvanized units) is easy, it requires seeking combats. Against passive opponents or in peaceful early games, you may struggle to accumulate galvanize tokens. If you cannot trigger combats Rounds 1-3, your scaling is delayed.

**4. Galvanize Snowball Requires Combats:**
Your entire power curve depends on fighting frequently. Against avoidance strategies (Ghosts teleporting away, Naalu using initiative to dodge fights, Nomad retreating), you cannot galvanize units and lose your faction's primary advantage. Peaceful metagames weaken Last Bastion significantly.

**5. Infantry Sustainability for Liberate:**
Liberate requires infantry equal to planet resources. High-resource planets (4-5 resources) need 4-5 infantry invasions, draining your ground forces. Without Sarween Tools or infantry production, you'll struggle to maintain Liberate-ready invasion forces across multiple conquests.

**6. Hero Timing Challenges:**
Your hero (Apollo) requires a galvanized unit to die, meaning you must lose a valuable unit to trigger the board clear. Opponents can play around this by avoiding destroying your galvanized units or focusing non-galvanized units first. Timing the hero trigger optimally is difficult.

**7. Flagship Scaling Takes Time:**
Your flagship scales with non-home planets controlled. Early game (2-4 planets), it's only combat 11-13. Mid-game (5-7 planets), combat 14-16. Only late-game (8+ planets) does it become truly dominant at combat 17+. You must survive long enough to reach late-game.

**8. Reliance on Starting Technology Choice:**
Your Round 1 technology choice (blue or yellow with no prerequisites) is permanent. If you choose poorly (e.g., Scanners instead of Fleet Logistics), you'll struggle all game. There's no recovery from a suboptimal starting tech decision.

## V. Technology

### A. Starting Technologies

**Choose One Blue or Yellow Technology with No Prerequisites:**

Detailed analysis of best choices:

**Top Tier (Recommended):**
1. **Fleet Logistics (Blue)** - 2 tactical actions per round = doubled tempo
2. **Gravity Drive (Blue)** - +1 movement for all ships = mobility
3. **Sarween Tools (Yellow)** - +1 fighter/infantry per production = economic efficiency for Liberate

**Mid Tier (Situational):**
4. **Neural Motivator (Yellow)** - +1 command token per status phase = sustainability
5. **Antimass Deflectors (Blue)** - +1 movement capacity = minor utility

**Low Tier (Avoid):**
6. **Graviton Laser System (Yellow)** - PDS bonus; you don't build PDS early
7. **Scanners (Blue)** - Movement + system reveal; niche utility
8. **Predictive Intelligence (Yellow)** - Action card cancel; too situational

### B. Technology Paths

**Primary Path (Fleet Logistics Start):**

Round 1: **Fleet Logistics (Blue - starting choice)**
- 2 tactical actions per round
- Aggressive expansion engine
- Unlocks immediate double-tempo

Round 2: **Sarween Tools (Yellow)**
- +1 fighter/infantry per production
- Supports Liberate infantry requirements
- Economic efficiency

Round 3: **Helios V2 (Yellow Faction Tech)**
- Upgrade space docks to production +4, resource +2
- Requires 1 yellow prerequisite (have Sarween Tools)
- Dramatically boosts economy

Round 4: **Proxima Targeting VI (Red Faction Tech) OR Carrier II**
- Proxima: Cancel bombardment hits, optional BOMBARDMENT 8 x3
- Carrier II: Better capacity and combat
- Depends on game state

Round 5+: **The Icon (Yellow <> Red) Breakthrough**
- Produce ships in forward systems
- Requires yellow + red prerequisites
- Game-changing production flexibility

**Alternative Path (Gravity Drive Start):**

Round 1: **Gravity Drive (Blue - starting choice)**
- +1 movement for all ships
- Rapid expansion

Round 2: **Sarween Tools (Yellow)**
- Economic efficiency

Round 3: **Fleet Logistics (Blue)**
- 2 tactical actions (critical to get eventually)

Round 4: **Helios V2 (Yellow Faction Tech)**
- Space dock upgrade

Round 5+: **The Icon (Yellow <> Red) OR unit upgrades**

### C. Key Technologies

**Helios V2 (1 Yellow Prerequisite - Faction Tech):**
*Last Bastion Space Dock: Capacity 5, PRODUCTION: Planet +4. The resource value of this planet is increased by 2.*

- Upgrade your unique space docks
- Production +4 (vs standard +1)
- **+2 planet resource value** (transforms economy)
- Example: 2-resource planet + Helios V2 = 4 resources
- Helios VI (starting) gives +1 resource; V2 gives +2 resource
- Only requires 1 yellow prerequisite (easy to research)
- Critical mid-game technology

**Proxima Targeting VI (Red - Faction Tech):**
*Cancel 1 hit produced by BOMBARDMENT rolls made against your ground forces for each of your galvanized units present. At the start of a round of ground combat, you may resolve BOMBARDMENT 8 (X3) against your opponent's ground forces; if you do, make an identical roll against your own ground forces.*

- Cancel 1 bombardment hit per galvanized ground force
- Example: 3 galvanized infantry = cancel 3 bombardment hits
- **Optional BOMBARDMENT 8 x3**: Roll 3 dice at 8+ against BOTH your and opponent's ground forces
- High-risk, high-reward bombardment
- Use when you have more/better ground forces or galvanized infantry to sustain damage
- Requires 1 red prerequisite

**The Icon (Yellow <> Red - Breakthrough):**
*When you produce ships, you may exhaust this card to place those ships in a system that contains 1 of your command tokens, at least 1 of your ground forces, and no other player's ships.*

- Produce ships in forward systems
- Requires command token + ground forces in target system, no enemy ships
- Bypasses space dock placement entirely
- Game-changing production flexibility
- Enables rapid reinforcement of frontlines
- Requires yellow + red prerequisites

**Fleet Logistics (Blue):**
*During each of your turns in the action phase, you may perform 2 actions instead of 1.*

- 2 tactical actions per round
- Essential for competitive play
- If not chosen as starting tech, research Round 2-3 minimum

**Sarween Tools (Yellow):**
*When 1 or more of your units use PRODUCTION, that unit produces 1 additional hit; that hit must be used to produce fighters or infantry.*

- +1 free fighter or infantry per production
- Critical for Liberate invasions (need infantry equal to planet resources)
- Economic efficiency technology

## VI. Strategy Cards

### A. Round 1 Ratings

**Leadership (1):** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ - High Value
Command tokens for aggressive expansion. Ordinian legendary exhausts for command token, but Leadership accelerates tempo. Secondary is excellent.

**Diplomacy (2):** ⭐⭐ - Low Value
Planet readying less valuable when Liberate readies planets automatically. Skip unless defending Mecatol.

**Politics (3):** ⭐⭐⭐ - Moderate Value
Speaker token is okay, action card draw is decent. Low influence (2) makes voting weak. Situational pick.

**Construction (4):** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Maximum Value
You need more Helios space docks to increase planet resources. Each Helios dock transforms a planet's economy. Top-tier Round 1.

**Trade (5):** ⭐ - Minimum Value
Only 1 commodity. Worst Trade faction in the game. Never pick unless absolutely desperate.

**Warfare (6):** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ - High Value
Remove tokens, redistribute fleets, seek combats to galvanize units. Solid aggressive pick.

**Technology (7):** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Maximum Value
You need Helios V2, Proxima Targeting, and The Icon. Tech path is critical. Top-tier Round 1.

**Imperial (8):** ⭐⭐⭐ - Moderate Value
Scoring is nice if objectives are scoreable. Otherwise, aggressive picks (Construction, Technology) are better.

### B. General Strategy Card Priority

**Rounds 2-3:**
- **Technology (7):** Push toward Helios V2, Proxima Targeting
- **Construction (4):** Build Helios space docks to increase planet resources
- **Warfare (6):** Seek combats to galvanize units
- **Leadership (1):** Command token replenishment for sustained aggression

**Rounds 4-5:**
- **Warfare (6):** Multi-front combats, galvanize accumulation
- **Imperial (8):** Scoring from objectives
- **Technology (7):** The Icon breakthrough
- **Construction (4):** Forward space docks if needed

**Round 6+:**
- **Imperial (8):** Score to close out the game
- **Warfare (6):** Tactical flexibility, galvanize final units
- **Leadership (1):** Command token pool management

## VII. Intermediate

### A. Unit Composition

**Early Game Fleet (Rounds 1-2):**
- 1-2 Dreadnoughts (galvanize priority targets)
- 2-3 Carriers (transport infantry for Liberate)
- 2-3 Cruisers (affordable combat units to galvanize)
- 4-6 Fighters (screening)
- 8-12 Infantry (Liberate invasions)
- 2 Space Docks (Helios VI on 2 planets)
- 0-1 PDS (low priority)

**Mid Game Fleet (Rounds 3-4):**
- 3-4 Dreadnoughts (galvanized for combat dominance)
- 3-4 Carriers (sustained invasions)
- 4-6 Cruisers (galvanized for cost-efficient firepower)
- 8-10 Fighters (screening)
- 12-16 Infantry (Liberate sustainability)
- 3-4 Helios Space Docks (V2 upgrades)
- 1-2 PDS (optional)
- 1 Flagship (scaling combat with planet count)

**Late Game Fleet (Rounds 5-6+):**
- 4-6 Dreadnoughts (all galvanized)
- 4-5 Carriers
- 6-8 Cruisers (galvanized, cost-efficient)
- 10-12 Fighters
- 16-20 Infantry (galvanized via mech triggers)
- 4-5 Helios Space Docks (empire-wide V2 upgrades)
- 2-3 PDS (defensive coverage)
- 1 Flagship (combat 15-20 with planet scaling)
- 2-4 Mechs (spread galvanize to infantry)

**Key Principles:**
- Galvanize dreadnoughts and cruisers first (single-die units benefit most from +1 die)
- Carriers for transport, not galvanize priority
- Infantry spam for Liberate
- Flagship becomes game-winning late-game with 8+ planets

### B. Point Planning

**"Christmas Land" Scoring Table:**

| Round | Public Objective 1 | Public Objective 2 | Secret Objective | Mecatol/Other | Total Points | Running Total |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 | Control 6 Planets (1) | - | - | - | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 6 Technologies (1) | 3 Ships in Non-Home (1) | Exploring Borders (1) | - | 3 | 4 |
| 3 | Spend 8 Resources (1) | Control 3 Cultural (1) | - | Mecatol (1) | 3 | 7 |
| 4 | Control 11 Planets (2) | 5+ Technologies (2) | Win vs 3+ Ships (1) | - | 5 | 12 |
| 5 | - | - | - | Imperial Point (1) | 1 | 13 |
| 6 | Win vs 2 Ships (2 systems) (2) | Spend 8 Resources (2) | - | Support Throne (1) | 5 | 18 |

This scenario shows Last Bastion leveraging territorial control (Liberate expansion), combat objectives (galvanized fleets), and Helios resource economy to reach 18+ points.

**Realistic Adjustments:**

**Legend:** 🟢 Likely | 🟡 Possible | 🔴 Difficult

Last Bastion's galvanized units and Helios economy excel at combat and territorial scoring. Low commodities hamper trade objectives.

## IX. Alliance Priority

Your alliance ability (granting Phoenix Standard) is **moderately powerful** and best traded to aggressive, combat-focused factions.

**High-Value Alliance Partners:**

1. **Aggressive War Factions:**
   - **Sardakk N'orr:** Galvanized units with +1 combat = devastating
   - **L1Z1X Mindnet:** Dreadnought spam + galvanize = unstoppable armada
   - **Barony of Letnev:** Dreadnought-heavy fleets benefit from galvanize
   - **Sol Federation:** Lots of combats; galvanize accumulates quickly

2. **Factions with High-Value Single-Die Units:**
   - **Titans of Ul:** War Suns benefit massively from +1 die
   - **Arborec:** Dreadnoughts and carriers benefit
   - **Mentak Coalition:** Cruiser-heavy fleets benefit

3. **Ground-Combat-Heavy Factions:**
   - **Yin Brotherhood:** Galvanized infantry with kamikaze synergy
   - **Naalu Collective:** Mech-focused; galvanize mechs

**Low-Value Alliance Partners:**

- **Hacan:** Trade faction; avoids combat
- **Jol-Nar:** Fragile; avoids combat
- **Winnu:** Weak military

**What to Demand in Exchange:**

- **Economic Support:** Trade goods, commodities (you have 1 commodity)
- **Political Support:** Votes on agendas (you have 2 influence)
- **Territory Agreements:** Non-aggression pacts, shared conquest targets
- **Military Support:** Joint wars or defense of your territory

**Timing Considerations:**

- Early alliance (Rounds 1-2): Secures non-aggression, helps political weakness
- Mid alliance (Rounds 3-4): Enables joint Mecatol conquest or shared combat objectives
- Late alliance (Rounds 5-6): Avoid empowering competitors; only if necessary

## X. End Notes

The Last Bastion are a **snowballing combat faction** that transforms every fight into a permanent power increase through galvanize tokens. Your success depends on **seeking frequent combats, leveraging Liberate for economic acceleration, and scaling your flagship to game-winning combat values**.

**Key Principles for Success:**

1. **Seek Combats Aggressively:** Every combat galvanizes 1 unit. Even losing battles leaves you stronger.

2. **Prioritize Galvanizing Single-Die Units:** Dreadnoughts, cruisers, flagship benefit most from +1 die. Multi-die units (carriers, war suns) gain less value.

3. **Liberate with Precision:** Always invade with infantry ≥ planet resources to ready planets immediately. Plan infantry production accordingly.

4. **Helios V2 Transforms Economy:** +2 resource per planet is massive. Prioritize researching and deploying Helios V2 docks.

5. **Choose Starting Tech Wisely:** Fleet Logistics, Gravity Drive, or Sarween Tools. This decision is permanent and game-defining.

6. **Commander Unlocks Easily:** 3 galvanized units = immunity to Sabotage and Nekro. Reach this by Round 2-3.

7. **Flagship Scales Exponentially:** With 8+ planets, combat 17+ flagship auto-hits everything. Expand territorially to maximize flagship.

8. **Hero Timing:** Use Apollo when a high-combat-value galvanized unit (dreadnought at 5, flagship at 9+) dies to maximize board clear.

9. **The Icon Breakthrough:** Producing ships in forward systems is game-changing. Research yellow + red path.

10. **Accept Economic Weakness:** 1 commodity is permanent. Focus on conquest, not trade.

Last Bastion rewards **sustained aggression and tactical galvanize management**. Every combat makes you stronger, and your Liberate economy accelerates faster than any faction. Master galvanize prioritization, Liberate infantry planning, and flagship scaling to dominate the late-game. When played optimally, Last Bastion becomes an unstoppable juggernaut.

**The Phoenix rises from every battle. Strength through adversity.**
