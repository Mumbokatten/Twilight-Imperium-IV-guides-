# Nekro Virus Guide

![Nekro Virus](NekroArt.webp)

---

## I. Introduction

The Nekro Virus are TI4's tech-stealing cyborg faction that cannot research technologies normally. Instead, they copy technologies by destroying enemy ships in combat and predicting agendas correctly. Nekro demands aggressive play, constant combat, and political maneuvering to compensate for their inability to vote. They start with unique Valefar Assimilator technologies that can copy enemy faction techs.

The payoff? Having more technologies than anyone else by mid-game through combat, wielding the devastating Alastor flagship with ground forces participating in space combat, and turning every battle into a research opportunity. When you master target selection and timing, every combat becomes a Technology primary and your tech diversity exceeds all other factions.

## II. Playstyle

Playing Nekro Virus is like being a technological vampire—you must feed on your enemies to grow stronger. Your Technology Singularity steals techs when you destroy enemy ships, your Galactic Threat predicts agendas to steal techs from voters, and your Propagation converts research actions into command tokens. You're not trying to win peacefully—you're winning through aggression, tech theft, and overwhelming technological superiority.

The key strength of Nekro is technological breadth. Normal factions research 5-7 techs carefully. You'll have 10-12 techs by endgame, stolen from multiple opponents, giving you unit upgrades and utility techs that no normal faction could afford. Understanding WHO to fight and WHEN separates good Nekro players from great ones.

Opponents will hate you—you're incentivized to attack everyone, and your power scales with their destruction. That moment when you've stolen 8+ technologies by Round 3 and your fleet is more advanced than the tech factions? Pure efficiency.

## III. The Basics

### A. Home System & Commodities

**Home System:** Mordai II (4 resources / 0 influence)

**Commodities:** 3

**Notes:** Single-planet home with 4 resources and 0 influence. The 4 resources fund your military production, but 0 influence means you rely entirely on conquering planets for influence objectives. Single-planet home is easier to defend than multi-planet systems.

### B. Starting Fleet

- 1 Dreadnought
- 1 Carrier
- 1 Cruiser
- 2 Fighters
- 2 Infantry
- 1 Space Dock

**Notes:** Strong starting fleet with a dreadnought for early aggression. The cruiser + carrier provide capacity for expansion. Your starting fleet is designed for R1 combat—use it aggressively to steal your first technologies.

### C. Starting Technologies

**Dacxive Animators (Green)** - After you win a ground combat, you may place 1 infantry from your reinforcements on that planet.

**Valefar Assimilator X** - When you gain another player's technology using one of your faction abilities, you may place the "X" assimilator token on a faction technology owned by that player instead. While that token is on a technology, this card gains that technology's text. You cannot place an assimilator token on technology that already has an assimilator token.

**Valefar Assimilator Y** - When you gain another player's technology using one of your faction abilities, you may place the "Y" assimilator token on a faction technology owned by that player instead. While that token is on a technology, this card gains that technology's text. You cannot place an assimilator token on technology that already has an assimilator token.

**Notes:** Dacxive Animators spawns infantry after ground combat wins—excellent for conquest. Valefar Assimilators X and Y let you copy enemy FACTION technologies instead of normal techs when stealing. This is incredibly powerful—you can copy Jol-Nar's E-Res Siphons, Yin's Impulse Core, Naalu's Neuroglaive, etc.

### D. Faction Abilities

**Galactic Threat (Faction Ability):** You cannot vote on agendas. Once per agenda phase, after an agenda is revealed, you may predict aloud the outcome of that agenda. If your prediction is correct, gain 1 technology that is owned by a player who voted how you predicted.

Cannot vote on agendas, which is crippling politically. However, once per agenda phase, predict the outcome. If correct, steal a tech from ANY player who voted that way. This is free technology generation if you read the table correctly. Over 5 rounds with 2 agendas each, correct predictions net 5-10 free techs.

**Technology Singularity (Faction Ability):** Once per combat, after 1 of your opponent's units is destroyed, you may gain 1 technology that is owned by that player.

Your defining ability. Once per combat (not per ship—per entire combat), after destroying an enemy unit, steal one of their technologies. This incentivizes constant aggression. Every combat is a research opportunity. Fight tech-rich opponents (Jol-Nar, Argent, Naaz-Rokha) to steal their best techs.

**Propagation (Faction Ability):** You cannot research technology. When you would research a technology, gain 3 command tokens instead.

You CANNOT research technologies normally. If you follow Technology primary/secondary, instead of researching, gain 3 CCs. This seems bad but actually provides excellent economy—3 CCs fund more aggression for more tech theft. After Commander unlocks, this becomes "gain 3 CCs + 1 tech" which is absurd value.

### E. Leaders

**Agent - Nekro Malleon:**

During the action phase: You may exhaust this card to choose a player; that player may discard 1 action card or spend 1 command token from their command sheet to gain 2 trade goods.

Conversion agent. Target player chooses: lose 1 action card OR lose 1 CC from command sheet, gain 2 TGs. Use this politically: "I'll agent you for 2 TGs if you vote X way." Also useful to drain opponent action cards before critical rounds.

**Commander - Nekro Acidos:** *Unlock: Own 3 technologies. A "Valefar Assimilator" technology counts only if its X or Y token is on a technology.*

After you gain a technology: You may draw 1 action card.

Unlocks after owning 3 technologies (Valefar Assimilators only count if you've placed their tokens). Every time you gain a tech (combat theft, agenda prediction, Propagation post-Commander), draw 1 action card. This generates massive card advantage—stealing 8 techs means drawing 8 action cards over the game.

**Hero - UNIT.DSGN.FLAYESH:** *Unlock: Have 3 scored objectives.*

**Polymorphic Algorithm - ACTION:** Choose a planet that has a technology specialty in a system that contains your units. Destroy any other player's units on that planet. Gain trade goods equal to the planet's combined resource and influence values and gain 1 technology that matches the specialty of that planet. Then, purge this card.

Planet destruction hero. Target a planet with tech specialty in system with your units. Destroy ALL enemy units on it, gain TGs equal to its resource + influence, and gain 1 tech matching its specialty (blue/green/red/yellow). Use this on high-value legendary planets (Mallice, Primor) or heavily defended tech specialty planets.

### F. Promissory Note - **Antivirus**

At the start of a combat: Place this card faceup in your play area. While this card is in your play area, the Nekro player cannot use his Technological Singularity faction ability against you. If you activate a system that contains 1 or more of the Nekro player's units, return this card to the Nekro player.

Prevents Nekro from stealing techs from the holder in combat. This is valuable for tech-heavy factions (Jol-Nar, Argent). Trade this for non-aggression pacts, voting support, or alliance promissories. Trade value: 3-4 TG equivalent.

### G. Alliance

After you gain a technology: Place 1 infantry from your reinforcements on any planet you control.

Infantry spawn on tech gain. Solid defensive value. Every time you steal a tech (which you do constantly), spawn 1 infantry anywhere. Over a game, this spawns 10+ free infantry. Trade value: 3-4 TG.

### H. Mech - **Mordred**

Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | **Sustain Damage**

**Special Ability:** During combat against an opponent who has an "X" or "Y" token on 1 or more of their technologies, apply +2 to the result of each of this unit's combat rolls.

Anti-theft mech. If you've placed Valefar Assimilator X or Y tokens on an opponent's faction tech, your mechs get +2 to combat rolls against them. This makes your mechs Combat 4 effective—devastating in ground combat. Place X/Y tokens on key opponents to unlock this bonus.

### I. Flagship - **The Alastor**

Cost: 8 | Combat: 9 (x2) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 3 | **Sustain Damage**

**Special Ability:** At the start of a space combat, choose any number of your ground forces in this system to participate in that combat as if they were ships.

Ground forces as ships flagship. At start of space combat, your infantry/mechs in the system can participate AS SHIPS. If you have flagship + 4 infantry in system, you roll 6 combat dice total (2 flagship at 9+, 4 infantry at 8+). This is devastating—every invasion brings overwhelming space combat power.

**Strategic Implications:**
- Load Alastor with 3 infantry for invasions
- At space combat start, 3 infantry participate (3 extra dice at 8+)
- Total: 5 combat dice (2 at 9+, 3 at 8+)
- This deletes most defender fleets
- If you lose infantry in space combat, you still have survivors for ground combat

### J. Faction Technologies

**Valefactor Assimilator X** - When you gain another player's technology using 1 of your faction abilities, you may place the "X" assimilator token on a faction technology owned by that player instead. While that token is on a technology, this card gains that technology's text. You cannot place an assimilator token on technology that already has an assimilator token.

Upgraded Valefar X. Same as starting tech but with "Valefactor" name. This doesn't exist in base game—you start with Valefar X already. This entry seems to be a data error.

**Valefactor Assimilator Y** - When you gain another player's technology using 1 of your faction abilities, you may place the "Y" assimilator token on a faction technology owned by that player instead. While that token is on a technology, this card gains that technology's text. You cannot place an assimilator token on technology that already has an assimilator token.

Upgraded Valefar Y. Same as starting tech but with "Valefactor" name. This also seems to be a data error.

**Note:** Your true "faction tech upgrades" are the Valefar Assimilators which you start with. Place their tokens strategically on enemy faction techs for maximum value.

### K. Breakthrough Technology

**Valefar Assimilator Z (Temporal Entanglement)** - When you would gain another player's technology using one of your faction abilities, you may instead place one of your "Z" assimilator tokens on that player's faction sheet. Your flagship gains the text abilities of that faction's flagship in addition to its own.

Flagship copying breakthrough. When stealing techs, instead place Z token on enemy faction sheet. Your Alastor gains their flagship's abilities IN ADDITION to your own. Copy Saar's Scuttle ability, Arborec's PRODUCTION 5, Argent's increased dice, Nomad's teleportation, etc. Your flagship becomes a hybrid super-flagship.

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

### A. Universal Table Hate

Everyone knows you must attack to gain techs. This makes you the table's villain automatically. Expect coordinated opposition, defensive alliances against you, and constant political targeting.

**Mitigation:**
- Make early non-aggression pacts with 1-2 neighbors
- Trade Antivirus to your weakest neighbor for protection
- Direct aggression toward shared enemies ("Let's both attack Player X")
- Present yourself as table police against VP leader

### B. Cannot Vote on Agendas

Galactic Threat prevents voting, crippling your political power. You rely on prediction for tech gain, but you cannot directly influence outcomes.

**Mitigation:**
- Use Agent to drain opponent action cards/CCs for political favors
- Trade military support for voting coalitions
- Predict popular outcomes for free techs
- Control Speaker to set favorable agendas

### C. Technology Dependency on Opponents

Your power scales with opponent tech counts. Neighbors with few techs (Sardakk 0, Winnu 1, Arborec 1 faction tech) cripple your gameplan.

**Mitigation:**
- Identify tech-rich neighbors pre-draft if possible
- Attack PAST weak neighbors to reach tech-rich targets
- Use Galactic Threat predictions to steal from distant tech-heavy opponents
- Prioritize killing tech-faction ships in multi-player combats

### D. Early Weakness

You have 3 starting techs (Dacxive + 2 Valefars) which is below average. Your Alastor is strong, but you're vulnerable R1-2 before tech theft snowballs.

**Mitigation:**
- Don't overextend R1—take 1-2 techs and consolidate
- Protect Alastor at all costs
- Use starting dreadnought + cruiser for defensive screens
- Score easy objectives R1 (Expand Borders, Engineer a Marvel) for points

---

## V. Technology

### A. Technology Stealing Priority

Since you steal techs rather than researching, prioritize targets by tech value:

**Tier S (Always Steal):**
- Carrier II
- Destroyer II
- Dreadnought II
- Cruiser II
- Gravity Drive
- Fleet Logistics
- Assault Cannon

**Tier A (Steal When Needed):**
- Fighter II
- Infantry II
- PDS II
- Sarween Tools
- AI Development Algorithm
- Duranium Armor
- Antimass Deflectors

**Tier B (Situational):**
- Space Dock II
- War Sun
- Transit Diodes
- Neural Motivator
- Scanlink Drone Network
- Light/Wave Deflectors

**Tier C (Usually Skip):**
- Dacxive Animators (you already have it)
- Bio-Stims
- Most prerequisite-only techs

### B. Valefar Assimilator Token Placement

You have X and Y tokens to place on enemy faction technologies. Choose wisely:

**Best Faction Techs to Copy:**

1. **Jol-Nar - E-Res Siphons:** Exhausted planets count for spending. Absurd for spend objectives.
2. **Jol-Nar - Spatial Conduit Network:** Create wormholes. Incredible mobility.
3. **Naalu - Neuroglaive:** Fighters hit on 8+. Your infantry-flagships become terrifying.
4. **Yin - Impulse Core:** +1 move to all ships. Amazing.
5. **Titans - Coalescence:** Force opponents to fight. Excellent for tech theft.
6. **Saar - Chaos Mapping:** Move through asteroids. Strong mobility.
7. **Arborec - Bioplasmosis:** Replace space docks with PDS anywhere. Unique utility.

**Token Placement Strategy:**
- Place X token early (R2-3) on most valuable faction tech
- Place Y token mid-game (R4-5) on second most valuable
- Prioritize techs that synergize with your playstyle (combat/mobility)
- Remember: Mech gets +2 combat against opponents with X/Y tokens

### C. Commander Tech Advantage

After Commander unlocks (3 technologies owned, Valefar tokens count if placed), every tech gain draws 1 action card. This includes:
- Technology Singularity steals (combat)
- Galactic Threat predictions (agendas)
- Propagation conversions (if you follow Tech secondary)

**Optimal Strategy:**
- Unlock Commander by R2-3 (should have 3+ techs by then)
- Steal 2-3 techs per round after unlocking
- Draw 2-3 action cards per round
- By R5, you'll have 10+ action cards played

### D. Recommended Tech Targets by Round

**Round 1:**
- Steal 1-2 unit upgrades (Carrier II, Destroyer II) OR economic tech (Sarween Tools)
- Target: Weakest military neighbor with good techs

**Round 2:**
- Steal 2-3 more techs for total of 5-6
- Focus: Diversify colors for objectives
- Place first Valefar token (X) on valuable faction tech

**Round 3:**
- Commander should unlock
- Steal 2-3 techs + draw action cards
- Place second Valefar token (Y)

**Round 4-5:**
- Steal specialized techs (Gravity Drive, Fleet Logistics, Assault Cannon)
- Complete "2 in each color" tech distribution
- Aim for 10-12 total techs by endgame

---

## VI. Strategy Cards

### Round One

**NEVER:**
- **Technology:** You CANNOT research. Propagation gives you 3 CCs instead, which is terrible value R1. Avoid at all costs.

**GREAT:**
- Warfare (enables R1 aggression + fleet unlocking)
- Leadership (CCs for expansion + aggression)
- Imperial (if you can score, which is unlikely R1)

**GOOD:**
- Politics (Speaker for agenda control even without votes)
- Trade (3 commodities + TGs for expansion)
- Diplomacy (protect home while attacking)

**MEDIOCRE:**
- Construction (you don't need many docks R1)

**BAD:**
- Technology (you cannot use this!)

### General Preferences

**Leadership:** LOVE - CCs fuel your constant aggression. You attack more than any faction.

**Diplomacy:** LIKE - Protect home while invading opponents. Readying for objectives.

**Politics:** LOVE - Control agendas + Speaker. Use Agent for political trades.

**Construction:** HATE - Limited structure needs. Others value this more.

**Trade:** LIKE - 3 commodities + TGs for military funding.

**Warfare:** LOVE - You attack every round. Unlocking fleets is critical.

**Technology:** HATE - Propagation only gives 3 CCs. This is trap unless Commander unlocked + you follow for 3 CCs + 1 tech.

**Imperial:** NEED - Points are points.

## VII. Intermediate

### A. Alastor Flagship Tactics

Your flagship's ability (ground forces participate in space combat) is game-changing:

**Optimal Loading:**
- 3 infantry on Alastor at all times
- At space combat start, 3 infantry fight as ships
- Total combat dice: 2 flagship (9+) + 3 infantry (8+) = 5 dice
- Expected hits per round: ~1.5 hits

**Advanced Tactics:**

1. **Infantry Expendability:** Infantry dying in space combat is acceptable—saves flagship from hits
2. **Mech Integration:** Load 1 mech + 2 infantry. Mech fights at 6 (or 4 if +2 bonus applies), provides Sustain
3. **Hero Synergy:** Load more ground forces before Hero activation for overwhelming dice

**Invasion Combo:**
- Approach enemy system with Alastor + 3 infantry
- Declare space combat, ground forces participate
- Roll 5 combat dice, destroy enemy fleet
- Land surviving ground forces for invasion
- Even if 2 infantry die in space combat, 1 survives for ground combat + Dacxive spawns 1 more after ground win

### B. Technology Singularity Timing

You can steal 1 tech per combat. Maximize value:

**Target Selection:**
1. Which ship to kill? Kill ship from player with most valuable unstolen techs
2. Which tech to steal? Prioritize unit upgrades > mobility techs > economic techs
3. Preserve future theft? Don't eliminate tech-rich opponents early—farm them for multiple rounds

**Example:**
- Fighting Jol-Nar with Carrier II, Cruiser II, Dreadnought II, Sarween Tools
- Round 1: Kill carrier, steal Carrier II
- Round 2: Kill cruiser, steal Cruiser II
- Round 3: Kill dreadnought, steal Dreadnought II
- Don't eliminate Jol-Nar! They'll research more techs for you to steal later

### C. Galactic Threat Prediction Optimization

Once per agenda, predict outcome for free tech if correct:

**Prediction Strategy:**

1. **Read the Table:** Identify voting coalitions before agenda phase
2. **Speaker Position:** If you're Speaker, set agendas with obvious outcomes
3. **Agent Intel:** Use Agent on key players to gauge their voting intentions
4. **Safe Predictions:** Predict on law agendas with strong consensus

**Tech Stealing from Predictions:**
- If you predict "For" and it passes, steal from ANY player who voted For
- Choose player with best unstolen techs (usually tech-heavy factions)
- This is free tech gain without combat

**Prediction Percentage Goals:**
- 50% accuracy: 5 free techs per game (2 agendas × 5 rounds × 50%)
- 70% accuracy: 7 free techs per game
- Combined with combat theft: 15-20 techs total

### D. Propagation Economy

You cannot research but gain 3 CCs when you would research:

**Before Commander:**
- Following Technology secondary = 3 CCs
- This is mediocre value (Leadership secondary = 2 CCs for 1 less resource)
- Avoid following Tech unless desperate for CCs

**After Commander:**
- Following Technology secondary = 3 CCs + 1 tech
- This is EXCELLENT value (free tech + 3 CCs)
- Follow Tech secondary every round if possible
- Prioritize taking Leadership/Trade to afford following Tech

**CC Generation:**
- Propagation: +3 CCs per follow
- Galactic Threat: +1 tech per correct agenda prediction (Commander draws card too)
- This funds aggressive expansion + constant combat

### E. Valefar Assimilator Z Breakthrough Strategy

Your breakthrough lets you copy enemy flagship abilities:

**Best Flagship Abilities to Copy:**

1. **Saar - Son of Ragh:** Scuttle (destroy for TGs) + AFB 6(x2). Combine with your ground force participation for absurd dice.
2. **Arborec - Duha Menaimon:** PRODUCTION 5. Your flagship becomes mobile production.
3. **Nomad - Memoria:** Teleport to mech systems. Incredible mobility.
4. **Argent - Crimson Hawk:** +1 die in first combat round. Your Alastor rolls 3 dice at 9+ round 1.
5. **Yin - Van Hauge:** +1 die for each opponent's non-fighter ship. Scales in large battles.

**Placement Timing:**
- Research Valefar Z breakthrough R3-4 if available
- Place Z token on faction with strongest flagship synergy
- Your Alastor gains their text IN ADDITION to ground force ability
- Combined flagship becomes game-winning

| Stake Your Claim (Control planet in contested system)                   | 🟢     |
| Strengthen Bonds (Have another player's PN)                             | 🟢     |

**Notes:**
- **Destroy their Greatest Ship** is EASY—you attack constantly and target flagships for tech theft
- **Form a Spy Network** is EASY—Commander draws cards when gaining techs; you'll discard 5+ easily
- **Darken the Skies** is EASY—you invade home systems for tech theft
- Combat-heavy secrets strongly favor Nekro's aggressive playstyle
- Agenda secrets (Dictate Policy, Drive the Debate) are HARD—you cannot vote

## IX. Alliance Priority

### S-Tier (Actively Pursue)

**Sardakk N'orr** - Mutual aggression pact. You both want to fight; coordinate targets. Trade Antivirus for territorial agreements. They lack techs but provide military support.

**Xxcha Kingdom** - Defensive alliance. They want peace; you provide military threat. Trade your aggression for their political support (Quash).

**Hacan** - Trade economy. They generate TGs for both players. You need funding for military. Trade Antivirus for trade deals.

### A-Tier (Opportunistic Alliances)

**Argent Flight** - Combat faction. Coordinate attacks on shared enemies. They have good techs to steal, but later (not early neighbors).

**Yin Brotherhood** - Combat faction. Both aggressive. Coordinate targets to avoid conflict. Trade Agent uses.

**Naalu Collective** - Initiative control. 0-token + your Alastor creates strong opening aggression.

### B-Tier (Neutral)

**Sol** - Ground force faction. Limited synergy. Neutral relationship.

**Titans of Ul** - PDS network faction. Trade territorial agreements.

**Barony of Letnev** - Debt economy. Limited synergy with your combat style.

### C-Tier (Difficult Synergies)

**Muaat** - Warsuns are hard to kill. Avoid conflict if possible. If you must fight, steal War Sun tech.

**Empyrean** - Can extract your Antivirus for disadvantageous trades.

### D-Tier (Avoid / Compete)

**Jol-Nar** - **PRIMARY TARGET.** They have 4 starting techs and research aggressively. You NEED to attack them for tech theft. Offer Antivirus to others, attack Jol-Nar relentlessly.

**Naaz-Rokha Alliance** - High tech count, good unit upgrades. Attack them mid-game for tech theft.

**Universities of Jol-Nar** - (Duplicate of Jol-Nar above)

## X. End Notes

Nekro Virus rewards:
- **Aggressive combat:** You must fight to gain technologies
- **Target selection:** Attack tech-rich opponents (Jol-Nar, Argent, Naaz-Rokha)
- **Political maneuvering:** Compensate for vote weakness with Agent trades
- **Technological breadth:** Steal diverse techs for objective versatility

You're a high-aggression faction that snowballs through combat. Master tech stealing timing and target prioritization, and you'll have 10-12 techs by R5—more than any other faction.

**Core Principles:**
1. Attack early R1-2 to steal first 3-5 techs
2. Protect Alastor—load it with infantry for overwhelming space combat
3. Place Valefar X/Y tokens on best enemy faction techs
4. Predict agendas correctly for free techs
5. Unlock Commander R2-3 for action card generation
6. Never take Technology strategy card (you cannot use it)

**The virus assimilates all.**
