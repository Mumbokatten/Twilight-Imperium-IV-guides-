<hr />
<h2 id="i.-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>The Nekro Virus are TI4’s tech-stealing cyborg hivemind that cannot
research technologies—they assimilate them through conquest. Every
destroyed ship is knowledge harvested, every correct agenda prediction
is understanding absorbed. You don’t build technology; you consume it
from those foolish enough to stand against the swarm.</p>
<p>This faction embodies relentless aggression. Your fleets don’t just
conquer—they learn. Your flagship doesn’t just fight—it weaponizes your
ground forces in space combat. While other factions carefully research
their technologies, you’ll have stolen double through sheer force. The
galaxy will fear the Nekro Virus not for what you build, but for what
you take.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-playstyle">II. Playstyle</h2>
<p>Playing Nekro Virus is like being a technological vampire—you must
feed on your enemies to grow stronger. Your Technology Singularity
steals techs when you destroy enemy ships, your Galactic Threat predicts
agendas to steal techs from voters, and your Propagation converts
research actions into command tokens. You’re not trying to win
peacefully—you’re winning through aggression, tech theft, and
overwhelming technological superiority.</p>
<p>The key strength of Nekro is technological breadth. Normal factions
carefully research their technologies. You’ll have double by endgame,
stolen from multiple opponents, giving you unit upgrades and utility
techs that no normal faction could afford. Understanding WHO to fight
and WHEN separates good Nekro players from great ones.</p>
<p>Opponents will hate you—you’re incentivized to attack everyone, and
your power scales with their destruction. That moment when you’ve
amassed stolen technologies and your fleet is more advanced than the
tech factions? Pure efficiency.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iii.-the-basics">III. The Basics</h2>
<h3 id="a.-home-system-commodities">A. Home System &amp;
Commodities</h3>
<p><strong>Home System:</strong> Mordai II (4 resources / 0
influence)</p>
<p><strong>Commodities:</strong> 3</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Single-planet home with 4 resources and 0
influence. The 4 resources fund your military production, but 0
influence means you rely entirely on conquering planets for influence
objectives. Single-planet home is easier to defend than multi-planet
systems.</p>
<h3 id="b.-starting-fleet">B. Starting Fleet</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 Dreadnought</li>
<li>1 Carrier</li>
<li>1 Cruiser</li>
<li>2 Fighters</li>
<li>2 Infantry</li>
<li>1 Space Dock</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Strong starting fleet with a dreadnought for
early aggression. The cruiser + carrier provide capacity for expansion.
Your starting fleet is designed for R1 combat—use it aggressively to
steal your first technologies.</p>
<h3 id="c.-faction-abilities">C. Faction Abilities</h3>
<p><strong>Galactic Threat (Faction Ability):</strong> You cannot vote
on agendas. Once per agenda phase, after an agenda is revealed, you may
predict aloud the outcome of that agenda. If your prediction is correct,
gain 1 technology that is owned by a player who voted how you
predicted.</p>
<p>Cannot vote on agendas, which is crippling politically. However, once
per agenda phase, predict the outcome. If correct, steal a tech from ANY
player who voted that way. This is free technology generation if you
read the table correctly. Over 5 rounds with 2 agendas each, correct
predictions net 5-10 free techs.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Singularity (Faction Ability):</strong> Once per
combat, after 1 of your opponent’s units is destroyed, you may gain 1
technology that is owned by that player.</p>
<p>Your defining ability. Once per combat (not per ship—per entire
combat), after destroying an enemy unit, steal one of their
technologies. This incentivizes constant aggression. Every combat is a
research opportunity. Fight tech-rich opponents (Jol-Nar, Argent,
Naaz-Rokha) to steal their best techs.</p>
<p><strong>Propagation (Faction Ability):</strong> You cannot research
technology. When you would research a technology, gain 3 command tokens
instead.</p>
<p>You CANNOT research technologies normally. If you follow Technology
primary/secondary, instead of researching, gain 3 CCs. This seems bad
but actually provides excellent economy—3 CCs fund more aggression for
more tech theft. After Commander unlocks, this becomes “gain 3 CCs + 1
tech” which is absurd value.</p>
<h3 id="d.-starting-and-faction-technologies">D. Starting and Faction
Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Technologies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dacxive Animators (G)</strong> - After you win a ground
combat, you may place 1 infantry from your reinforcements on that
planet.</p>
<p><strong>Valefar Assimilator X</strong> - When you gain another
player’s technology using one of your faction abilities, you may place
the “X” assimilator token on a faction technology owned by that player
instead. While that token is on a technology, this card gains that
technology’s text. You cannot place an assimilator token on technology
that already has an assimilator token.</p>
<p><strong>Valefar Assimilator Y</strong> - When you gain another
player’s technology using one of your faction abilities, you may place
the “Y” assimilator token on a faction technology owned by that player
instead. While that token is on a technology, this card gains that
technology’s text. You cannot place an assimilator token on technology
that already has an assimilator token.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Dacxive Animators spawns infantry after
ground combat wins—excellent for conquest. Valefar Assimilators X and Y
let you copy enemy FACTION technologies instead of normal techs when
stealing. This is incredibly powerful—you can copy Jol-Nar’s E-Res
Siphons, Yin’s Impulse Core, Naalu’s Neuroglaive, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Faction Technologies:</strong></p>
<p>(Note: Valefar Assimilator X and Y are your starting faction
technologies - see above. You have no additional faction technologies to
research since you cannot research technologies normally.)</p>
<h3 id="e.-leaders">E. Leaders</h3>
<p><strong>Agent - Nekro Malleon:</strong></p>
<p>During the action phase: You may exhaust this card to choose a
player; that player may discard 1 action card or spend 1 command token
from their command sheet to gain 2 trade goods.</p>
<p>Conversion agent. Target player chooses: lose 1 action card OR lose 1
CC from command sheet, gain 2 TGs. Use this politically: “I’ll agent you
for 2 TGs if you vote X way.” Also useful to drain opponent action cards
before critical rounds.</p>
<p><strong>Commander - Nekro Acidos:</strong> <em>Unlock: Own 3
technologies. A “Valefar Assimilator” technology counts only if its X or
Y token is on a technology.</em></p>
<p>After you gain a technology: You may draw 1 action card.</p>
<p>Unlocks after owning 3 technologies (Valefar Assimilators only count
if you’ve placed their tokens). Every time you gain a tech (combat
theft, agenda prediction, Propagation post-Commander), draw 1 action
card. This generates massive card advantage—stealing 8 techs means
drawing 8 action cards over the game.</p>
<p><strong>Hero - UNIT.DSGN.FLAYESH:</strong> <em>Unlock: Have 3 scored
objectives.</em></p>
<p><strong>Polymorphic Algorithm - ACTION:</strong> Choose a planet that
has a technology specialty in a system that contains your units. Destroy
any other player’s units on that planet. Gain trade goods equal to the
planet’s combined resource and influence values and gain 1 technology
that matches the specialty of that planet. Then, purge this card.</p>
<p>Planet destruction hero. Target a planet with tech specialty in
system with your units. Destroy ALL enemy units on it, gain TGs equal to
its resource + influence, and gain 1 tech matching its specialty
(blue/green/red/yellow). Use this on high-value legendary planets
(Mallice, Primor) or heavily defended tech specialty planets.</p>
<h3 id="f.-promissory-note---antivirus">F. Promissory Note -
<strong>Antivirus</strong></h3>
<p>At the start of a combat: Place this card faceup in your play area.
While this card is in your play area, the Nekro player cannot use his
Technological Singularity faction ability against you. If you activate a
system that contains 1 or more of the Nekro player’s units, return this
card to the Nekro player.</p>
<p>Prevents Nekro from stealing techs from the holder in combat. This is
valuable for tech-heavy factions (Jol-Nar, Argent). Trade this for
non-aggression pacts, voting support, or alliance promissories. Trade
value: 3-4 TG equivalent.</p>
<h3 id="g.-alliance">G. Alliance</h3>
<p>After you gain a technology: Place 1 infantry from your
reinforcements on any planet you control.</p>
<p>Infantry spawn on tech gain. Solid defensive value. Every time you
steal a tech (which you do constantly), spawn 1 infantry anywhere. Over
a game, this spawns 10+ free infantry. Trade value: 3-4 TG.</p>
<h3 id="h.-mech---mordred">H. Mech - <strong>Mordred</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | <strong>Sustain Damage</strong></p>
<p><strong>Special Ability:</strong> During combat against an opponent
who has an “X” or “Y” token on 1 or more of their technologies, apply +2
to the result of each of this unit’s combat rolls.</p>
<p>Anti-theft mech. If you’ve placed Valefar Assimilator X or Y tokens
on an opponent’s faction tech, your mechs get +2 to combat rolls against
them. This makes your mechs Combat 4 effective—devastating in ground
combat. Place X/Y tokens on key opponents to unlock this bonus.</p>
<h3 id="i.-flagship---the-alastor">I. Flagship - <strong>The
Alastor</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 8 | Combat: 9 (x2) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 3 | <strong>Sustain
Damage</strong></p>
<p><strong>Special Ability:</strong> At the start of a space combat,
choose any number of your ground forces in this system to participate in
that combat as if they were ships.</p>
<p>Ground forces as ships flagship. At start of space combat, your
infantry/mechs in the system can participate AS SHIPS. If you have
flagship + 4 infantry in system, you roll 6 combat dice total (2
flagship at 9+, 4 infantry at 8+). This is devastating—every invasion
brings overwhelming space combat power.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Implications:</strong> - Load Alastor with 3
infantry for invasions - At space combat start, 3 infantry participate
(3 extra dice at 8+) - Total: 5 combat dice (2 at 9+, 3 at 8+) - This
deletes most defender fleets - If you lose infantry in space combat, you
still have survivors for ground combat</p>
<h3 id="j.-faction-technologies">J. Faction Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Valefactor Assimilator X</strong> - When you gain another
player’s technology using 1 of your faction abilities, you may place the
“X” assimilator token on a faction technology owned by that player
instead. While that token is on a technology, this card gains that
technology’s text. You cannot place an assimilator token on technology
that already has an assimilator token.</p>
<p>Upgraded Valefar X. Same as starting tech but with “Valefactor” name.
This doesn’t exist in base game—you start with Valefar X already. This
entry seems to be a data error.</p>
<p><strong>Valefactor Assimilator Y</strong> - When you gain another
player’s technology using 1 of your faction abilities, you may place the
“Y” assimilator token on a faction technology owned by that player
instead. While that token is on a technology, this card gains that
technology’s text. You cannot place an assimilator token on technology
that already has an assimilator token.</p>
<p>Upgraded Valefar Y. Same as starting tech but with “Valefactor” name.
This also seems to be a data error.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Your true “faction tech upgrades” are the
Valefar Assimilators which you start with. Place their tokens
strategically on enemy faction techs for maximum value.</p>
<h3 id="k.-breakthrough-technology">K. Breakthrough Technology</h3>
<p><strong>Valefar Assimilator Z (Temporal Entanglement)</strong> - When
you would gain another player’s technology using one of your faction
abilities, you may instead place one of your “Z” assimilator tokens on
that player’s faction sheet. Your flagship gains the text abilities of
that faction’s flagship in addition to its own.</p>
<p>Flagship copying breakthrough. When stealing techs, instead place Z
token on enemy faction sheet. Your Alastor gains their flagship’s
abilities IN ADDITION to your own. Copy Saar’s Scuttle ability,
Arborec’s PRODUCTION 5, Argent’s increased dice, Nomad’s teleportation,
etc. Your flagship becomes a hybrid super-flagship.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iv.-structural-weaknesses">IV. Structural Weaknesses</h2>
<h3 id="a.-first-turn-priorities">A. First Turn Priorities</h3>
<p>As Nekro Virus, your first turn priorities should reflect your
tech-stealing combat strategy. Here’s the recommended ordering:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Expansion + Production</strong> - You CANNOT research
technology normally. Your only tech acquisition is Technology
Singularity (copy techs from destroyed opponent units in combat). Expand
to 2-3 systems Round 1 using your strong starting fleet (dreadnought + 2
cruisers). Your 3 resources and 3 influence from home support
this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Breakthrough</strong> - Seek combat IMMEDIATELY to
trigger tech theft. You need to destroy opponent ships/ground forces to
copy their technologies. Target factions with valuable starting techs
(Jol-Nar: 4 techs, Sol: 2 techs, Hacan: 2 techs). Even small victories
grant tech access. Commander unlocks with just 1 copied tech.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology</strong> - Propagation (choose color, gain
command token instead of researching) lets you bypass research
limitations. However, combat tech theft comes first—Propagation
supplements stolen technologies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scoring</strong> - Your early scoring potential is
limited until you’ve stolen 2-3 technologies (Round 2-3). Focus Round 1
on expansion and first combat victories. Tech diversity objectives
become easier after successful raids.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="a.-universal-table-hate">A. Universal Table Hate</h3>
<p>Everyone knows you must attack to gain techs. This makes you the
table’s villain automatically. Expect coordinated opposition, defensive
alliances against you, and constant political targeting.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> - Make early non-aggression pacts with
1-2 neighbors - Trade Antivirus to your weakest neighbor for protection
- Direct aggression toward shared enemies (“Let’s both attack Player X”)
- Present yourself as table police against VP leader</p>
<h3 id="b.-cannot-vote-on-agendas">B. Cannot Vote on Agendas</h3>
<p>Galactic Threat prevents voting, crippling your political power. You
rely on prediction for tech gain, but you cannot directly influence
outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> - Use Agent to drain opponent action
cards/CCs for political favors - Trade military support for voting
coalitions - Predict popular outcomes for free techs - Control Speaker
to set favorable agendas</p>
<h3 id="c.-technology-dependency-on-opponents">C. Technology Dependency
on Opponents</h3>
<p>Your power scales with opponent tech counts. Neighbors with few techs
(Sardakk 0, Winnu 1, Arborec 1 faction tech) cripple your gameplan.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> - Identify tech-rich neighbors pre-draft
if possible - Attack PAST weak neighbors to reach tech-rich targets -
Use Galactic Threat predictions to steal from distant tech-heavy
opponents - Prioritize killing tech-faction ships in multi-player
combats</p>
<h3 id="d.-early-weakness">D. Early Weakness</h3>
<p>You have 3 starting techs (Dacxive + 2 Valefars) which is below
average. Your Alastor is strong, but you’re vulnerable R1-2 before tech
theft snowballs.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> - Don’t overextend R1—take 1-2 techs and
consolidate - Protect Alastor at all costs - Use starting dreadnought +
cruiser for defensive screens - Score easy objectives R1 (Expand
Borders, Engineer a Marvel) for points</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="v.-technology">V. Technology</h2>
<h3 id="a.-technology-stealing-priority">A. Technology Stealing
Priority</h3>
<p>Since you steal techs rather than researching, prioritize targets by
tech value:</p>
<p><strong>Tier S (Always Steal):</strong> - Carrier II - Destroyer II -
Dreadnought II - Cruiser II - Gravity Drive - Fleet Logistics - Assault
Cannon</p>
<p><strong>Tier A (Steal When Needed):</strong> - Fighter II - Infantry
II - PDS II - Sarween Tools - AI Development Algorithm - Duranium Armor
- Antimass Deflectors</p>
<p><strong>Tier B (Situational):</strong> - Space Dock II - War Sun -
Transit Diodes - Neural Motivator - Scanlink Drone Network - Light/Wave
Deflectors</p>
<p><strong>Tier C (Usually Skip):</strong> - Dacxive Animators (you
already have it) - Bio-Stims - Most prerequisite-only techs</p>
<h3 id="b.-valefar-assimilator-token-placement">B. Valefar Assimilator
Token Placement</h3>
<p>You have X and Y tokens to place on enemy faction technologies.
Choose wisely:</p>
<p><strong>Best Faction Techs to Copy:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Jol-Nar - E-Res Siphons:</strong> Exhausted planets count
for spending. Absurd for spend objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Jol-Nar - Spatial Conduit Network:</strong> Create
wormholes. Incredible mobility.</li>
<li><strong>Naalu - Neuroglaive:</strong> Fighters hit on 8+. Your
infantry-flagships become terrifying.</li>
<li><strong>Yin - Impulse Core:</strong> +1 move to all ships.
Amazing.</li>
<li><strong>Titans - Coalescence:</strong> Force opponents to fight.
Excellent for tech theft.</li>
<li><strong>Saar - Chaos Mapping:</strong> Move through asteroids.
Strong mobility.</li>
<li><strong>Arborec - Bioplasmosis:</strong> Replace space docks with
PDS anywhere. Unique utility.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Token Placement Strategy:</strong> - Place X token early
(R2-3) on most valuable faction tech - Place Y token mid-game (R4-5) on
second most valuable - Prioritize techs that synergize with your
playstyle (combat/mobility) - Remember: Mech gets +2 combat against
opponents with X/Y tokens</p>
<h3 id="c.-commander-tech-advantage">C. Commander Tech Advantage</h3>
<p>After Commander unlocks (3 technologies owned, Valefar tokens count
if placed), every tech gain draws 1 action card. This includes: -
Technology Singularity steals (combat) - Galactic Threat predictions
(agendas) - Propagation conversions (if you follow Tech secondary)</p>
<p><strong>Optimal Strategy:</strong> - Unlock Commander by R2-3 (should
have 3+ techs by then) - Steal 2-3 techs per round after unlocking -
Draw 2-3 action cards per round - By R5, you’ll have 10+ action cards
played</p>
<h3 id="d.-recommended-tech-targets-by-round">D. Recommended Tech
Targets by Round</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1:</strong> - Steal 1-2 unit upgrades (Carrier II,
Destroyer II) OR economic tech (Sarween Tools) - Target: Weakest
military neighbor with good techs</p>
<p><strong>Round 2:</strong> - Steal 2-3 more techs for total of 5-6 -
Focus: Diversify colors for objectives - Place first Valefar token (X)
on valuable faction tech</p>
<p><strong>Round 3:</strong> - Commander should unlock - Steal 2-3 techs
+ draw action cards - Place second Valefar token (Y)</p>
<p><strong>Round 4-5:</strong> - Steal specialized techs (Gravity Drive,
Fleet Logistics, Assault Cannon) - Complete “2 in each color” tech
distribution - Aim for 10-12 total techs by endgame</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vi.-strategy-cards">VI. Strategy Cards</h2>
<h3 id="a.-round-1">A. Round 1</h3>
<p>Your R1 priority is aggressive expansion to steal technologies and
establish military dominance.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1 Priority Ranking:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Warfare</strong> - Enables R1 aggression + fleet
unlocking. You attack more than any faction.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leadership</strong> - CCs for expansion + aggression.
Essential for sustained attacks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Politics</strong> - Speaker for agenda control even
without votes. Use Agent for political trades.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trade</strong> - 3 commodities + TGs for military funding
and expansion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Protect home while attacking.
Readying for objectives.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Imperial</strong> - If you can score, which is unlikely
R1.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Construction</strong> - You don’t need many docks R1.
Others value this more.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology</strong> - You CANNOT research. Propagation
gives you 3 CCs instead, which is terrible value R1. Avoid at all
costs.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="b.-round-2">B. Round 2+</h3>
<p><strong>Love:</strong> - <strong>Leadership</strong> - CCs fuel your
constant aggression. Attack every round. - <strong>Warfare</strong> -
You attack every round. Unlocking fleets is critical for sustained
aggression. - <strong>Politics</strong> - Control agendas + Speaker. Use
Agent for political trades. - <strong>Imperial</strong> - Points are
points. Needed rounds 3-5.</p>
<p><strong>Like:</strong> - <strong>Trade</strong> - 3 commodities + TGs
for military funding. - <strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Protect home while
invading opponents. Readying for objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Situational:</strong> - <strong>Technology</strong> - HATE
unless Commander unlocked. Propagation only gives 3 CCs. Take only if
you can follow for 3 CCs + 1 tech after Commander unlock.</p>
<p><strong>Hate:</strong> - <strong>Construction</strong> - Limited
structure needs. Others value this more.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vii.-intermediate">VII. Intermediate</h2>
<h3 id="a.-alastor-flagship-tactics">A. Alastor Flagship Tactics</h3>
<p>Your flagship’s ability (ground forces participate in space combat)
is game-changing:</p>
<p><strong>Optimal Loading:</strong> - 3 infantry on Alastor at all
times - At space combat start, 3 infantry fight as ships - Total combat
dice: 2 flagship (9+) + 3 infantry (8+) = 5 dice - Expected hits per
round: ~1.5 hits</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Tactics:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Infantry Expendability:</strong> Infantry dying in space
combat is acceptable—saves flagship from hits</li>
<li><strong>Mech Integration:</strong> Load 1 mech + 2 infantry. Mech
fights at 6 (or 4 if +2 bonus applies), provides Sustain</li>
<li><strong>Hero Synergy:</strong> Load more ground forces before Hero
activation for overwhelming dice</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Invasion Combo:</strong> - Approach enemy system with Alastor
+ 3 infantry - Declare space combat, ground forces participate - Roll 5
combat dice, destroy enemy fleet - Land surviving ground forces for
invasion - Even if 2 infantry die in space combat, 1 survives for ground
combat + Dacxive spawns 1 more after ground win</p>
<h3 id="b.-technology-singularity-timing">B. Technology Singularity
Timing</h3>
<p>You can steal 1 tech per combat. Maximize value:</p>
<p><strong>Target Selection:</strong> 1. Which ship to kill? Kill ship
from player with most valuable unstolen techs 2. Which tech to steal?
Prioritize unit upgrades &gt; mobility techs &gt; economic techs 3.
Preserve future theft? Don’t eliminate tech-rich opponents early—farm
them for multiple rounds</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> - Fighting Jol-Nar with Carrier II, Cruiser
II, Dreadnought II, Sarween Tools - Round 1: Kill carrier, steal Carrier
II - Round 2: Kill cruiser, steal Cruiser II - Round 3: Kill
dreadnought, steal Dreadnought II - Don’t eliminate Jol-Nar! They’ll
research more techs for you to steal later</p>
<h3 id="c.-galactic-threat-prediction-optimization">C. Galactic Threat
Prediction Optimization</h3>
<p>Once per agenda, predict outcome for free tech if correct:</p>
<p><strong>Prediction Strategy:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Read the Table:</strong> Identify voting coalitions before
agenda phase</li>
<li><strong>Speaker Position:</strong> If you’re Speaker, set agendas
with obvious outcomes</li>
<li><strong>Agent Intel:</strong> Use Agent on key players to gauge
their voting intentions</li>
<li><strong>Safe Predictions:</strong> Predict on law agendas with
strong consensus</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tech Stealing from Predictions:</strong> - If you predict
“For” and it passes, steal from ANY player who voted For - Choose player
with best unstolen techs (usually tech-heavy factions) - This is free
tech gain without combat</p>
<p><strong>Prediction Percentage Goals:</strong> - 50% accuracy: 5 free
techs per game (2 agendas × 5 rounds × 50%) - 70% accuracy: 7 free techs
per game - Combined with combat theft: 15-20 techs total</p>
<h3 id="d.-propagation-economy">D. Propagation Economy</h3>
<p>You cannot research but gain 3 CCs when you would research:</p>
<p><strong>Before Commander:</strong> - Following Technology secondary =
3 CCs - This is mediocre value (Leadership secondary = 2 CCs for 1 less
resource) - Avoid following Tech unless desperate for CCs</p>
<p><strong>After Commander:</strong> - Following Technology secondary =
3 CCs + 1 tech - This is EXCELLENT value (free tech + 3 CCs) - Follow
Tech secondary every round if possible - Prioritize taking
Leadership/Trade to afford following Tech</p>
<p><strong>CC Generation:</strong> - Propagation: +3 CCs per follow -
Galactic Threat: +1 tech per correct agenda prediction (Commander draws
card too) - This funds aggressive expansion + constant combat</p>
<h3 id="e.-valefar-assimilator-z-breakthrough-strategy">E. Valefar
Assimilator Z Breakthrough Strategy</h3>
<p>Your breakthrough lets you copy enemy flagship abilities:</p>
<p><strong>Best Flagship Abilities to Copy:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Saar - Son of Ragh:</strong> Scuttle (destroy for TGs) + AFB
6(x2). Combine with your ground force participation for absurd
dice.</li>
<li><strong>Arborec - Duha Menaimon:</strong> PRODUCTION 5. Your
flagship becomes mobile production.</li>
<li><strong>Nomad - Memoria:</strong> Teleport to mech systems.
Incredible mobility.</li>
<li><strong>Argent - Crimson Hawk:</strong> +1 die in first combat
round. Your Alastor rolls 3 dice at 9+ round 1.</li>
<li><strong>Yin - Van Hauge:</strong> +1 die for each opponent’s
non-fighter ship. Scales in large battles.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Placement Timing:</strong> - Research Valefar Z breakthrough
R3-4 if available - Place Z token on faction with strongest flagship
synergy - Your Alastor gains their text IN ADDITION to ground force
ability - Combined flagship becomes game-winning</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="viii.-objectives">VIII. Objectives</h2>
<h3 id="a.-objective-summary">A. Objective Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Excels at tech objectives by stealing 10+
technologies through combat. Resource spending objectives are easy with
4 resource home system, and aggressive expansion supports control
objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Influence spending objectives are
extremely difficult with 0 home influence. Structure objectives are
challenging with military focus, and cannot vote for political
objectives.</p>

<h2 id="xi.-end-notes">XI. End Notes</h2>
<p>Nekro Virus is TI4’s ultimate combat faction—you don’t research, you
assimilate. Every battle is a learning opportunity, every destroyed ship
is stolen knowledge. You’re playing a completely different game from
everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>The Nekro Experience:</strong> You start aggressive and never
stop. Your dreadnought leads early invasions targeting tech-rich
opponents. Jol-Nar fears you. Argent avoids you. Naaz-Rokha watches
their borders nervously. Technology Singularity transforms every combat
into tech acquisition—fight early, fight often, fight smart. Your
Valefar Assimilators can copy enemy faction technologies, giving you
access to abilities no normal faction could stack.</p>
<p><strong>The Challenges:</strong> You cannot vote, making political
objectives nearly impossible. Your 0 influence home planet means
influence objectives are brutal. Everyone knows you must fight to grow
stronger, which makes you predictable and easy to counter-play. Lose
your flagship and you lose your space-combat superiority. Miss your
agenda predictions and you miss free technologies.</p>
<p><strong>What Makes It Fun:</strong> Stealing double the technologies
while tech factions struggle. Loading your Alastor flagship with
infantry and watching them participate in space combat. Correctly
predicting agendas and sniping the exact tech you need from voters. Your
Commander drawing action cards every time you steal tech—by late game
you’re drowning in cards. Conquering home systems for tech theft while
your opponents scramble to stop the virus from spreading.</p>
<p>Play aggressive, target wisely, assimilate ruthlessly, and prove that
the Nekro Virus adapts faster than any faction can innovate.</p>
<p><strong>The virus assimilates all.</strong></p>
