<hr />
<h2 id="i.-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>The Nekro Virus are TI4’s tech-stealing cyborg hivemind that cannot
research technologies—they assimilate them through conquest. Every
destroyed ship is knowledge harvested, every correct agenda prediction
is understanding absorbed. You don’t build technology; you consume it
from those foolish enough to stand against the swarm.</p>
<p>This faction embodies relentless aggression. Your fleets don’t just
conquer—they learn. Your flagship doesn’t just fight—it weaponizes your
ground forces in space combat. While other factions carefully research
their technologies, you’ll have stolen double through sheer force. The
galaxy will fear the Nekro Virus not for what you build, but for what
you take.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-playstyle">II. Playstyle</h2>
<p>Playing Nekro Virus is like being a technological vampire—you must
feed on your enemies to grow stronger. Your Technology Singularity
steals techs when you destroy enemy ships, your Galactic Threat predicts
agendas to steal techs from voters, and your Propagation converts
research actions into command tokens. You’re not trying to win
peacefully—you’re winning through aggression, tech theft, and
overwhelming technological superiority.</p>
<p>The key strength of Nekro is technological breadth. Normal factions
carefully research their technologies. You’ll have double by endgame,
stolen from multiple opponents, giving you unit upgrades and utility
techs that no normal faction could afford. Understanding WHO to fight
and WHEN separates good Nekro players from great ones.</p>
<p>Opponents will hate you—you’re incentivized to attack everyone, and
your power scales with their destruction. Early game, you’ll make deals
and non-aggression pacts to survive. Mid-to-late game, you become too
technologically advanced to care about those promises.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iii.-the-basics">III. The Basics</h2>
<h3 id="a.-home-system-commodities">A. Home System &amp;
Commodities</h3>
<p><strong>Home System:</strong> - <strong>Mordai II:</strong> 4
resources / 0 influence - <strong>Total: 4 resources / 0 influence (4
optimal resources / 0 optimal influence)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commodities:</strong> 3</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Single-planet home is easier to defend than
multi-planet systems. Usually factions with only resource home systems
are token starved, but Propagation fixes this—you gain 3 command tokens
when following Technology instead of researching. Mordai II is a strong
production hub with 4 resources for military builds. 0 influence means
you rely entirely on conquering planets for influence objectives.</p>
<h3 id="b.-starting-fleet">B. Starting Fleet</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 Dreadnought</li>
<li>1 Carrier</li>
<li>1 Cruiser</li>
<li>2 Fighters</li>
<li>2 Infantry</li>
<li>1 Space Dock</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Strong starting fleet in space with a
dreadnought for early aggression. The cruiser + carrier provide capacity
for expansion. Problem is only 2 infantry—this can make you slightly
limited in which slices you thrive in, as you need planets you can
reasonably conquer with minimal ground forces.</p>
<h3 id="c.-faction-abilities">C. Faction Abilities</h3>
<p><strong>Galactic Threat (Faction Ability):</strong> You cannot vote
on agendas. Once per agenda phase, after an agenda is revealed, you may
predict aloud the outcome of that agenda. If your prediction is correct,
gain 1 technology that is owned by a player who voted how you
predicted.</p>
<p>Cannot vote on agendas, which is crippling politically. However, once
per agenda phase, predict the outcome. If correct, steal a tech from ANY
player who voted that way. Maximum 5 techs over the game (one per
round), but realistically expect 2-3 because of the abstain
problem—everyone can abstain and the speaker decides the outcome to
screw you out of tech.</p>
<p><strong>Technology Singularity (Faction Ability):</strong> Once per
combat, after 1 of your opponent’s units is destroyed, you may gain 1
technology that is owned by that player.</p>
<p>Your defining ability. Once per combat (not per ship—per entire
combat), after destroying an enemy unit, steal one of their
technologies. This incentivizes constant aggression. Every combat is a
research opportunity. Note this happens in both space combat and ground
combat—invading a 2-planet system could net you 3 techs (1 from space, 1
from each ground combat).</p>
<p><strong>Propagation (Faction Ability):</strong> You cannot research
technology. When you would research a technology, gain 3 command tokens
instead.</p>
<p>You CANNOT research technologies normally. If you follow Technology
primary/secondary, instead of researching, gain 3 CCs. This seems bad
but actually provides excellent economy—3 CCs fund more aggression for
more tech theft. On the secondary, you spend 4 resources for a net +2
tokens (spend 1 from strategy pool, gain 3), which is a steal compared
to paying 6 influence for 2 tokens on Leadership.</p>
<h3 id="d.-starting-and-faction-technologies">D. Starting and Faction
Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Technologies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dacxive Animators (G)</strong> - After you win a ground
combat, you may place 1 infantry from your reinforcements on that
planet.</p>
<p>One of the worst starting technologies in the game—you’d take almost
any other. However, it’s helpful for unlocking your Commander and an
extra infantry here and there never hurts.</p>
<p><strong>Valefar Assimilator X</strong> - When you gain another
player’s technology using one of your faction abilities, you may place
the “X” assimilator token on a faction technology owned by that player
instead. While that token is on a technology, this card gains that
technology’s text. You cannot place an assimilator token on technology
that already has an assimilator token.</p>
<p><strong>Valefar Assimilator Y</strong> - When you gain another
player’s technology using one of your faction abilities, you may place
the “Y” assimilator token on a faction technology owned by that player
instead. While that token is on a technology, this card gains that
technology’s text. You cannot place an assimilator token on technology
that already has an assimilator token.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Valefar Assimilators let you copy enemy
FACTION technologies instead of normal techs when stealing. This is
incredibly powerful and makes you have 0 reason to be in Entropic Scar.
You can have high variance of how good the faction techs available in
the game can be, but usually there are some good ones.</p>
<h3 id="e.-leaders">E. Leaders</h3>
<p><strong>Agent - Nekro Malleon:</strong></p>
<p>During the action phase: You may exhaust this card to choose a
player; that player may discard 1 action card or spend 1 command token
from their command sheet to gain 2 trade goods.</p>
<p>Gives a surprising amount of economy and there’s no shortage of
useless action cards when you start pulling a few around.</p>
<p><strong>Commander - Nekro Acidos:</strong> <em>Unlock: Own 3
technologies. A “Valefar Assimilator” technology counts only if its X or
Y token is on a technology.</em></p>
<p>After you gain a technology: You may draw 1 action card.</p>
<p>Unlocks after owning 3 technologies (Valefar Assimilators only count
if you’ve placed their tokens). Every time you gain a tech (combat
theft, agenda prediction), draw 1 action card. Note that placing a
Valefar Assimilator token is NOT gaining a technology, so Commander
doesn’t trigger from that.</p>
<p><strong>Hero - UNIT.DSGN.FLAYESH:</strong> <em>Unlock: Have 3 scored
objectives.</em></p>
<p><strong>Polymorphic Algorithm - ACTION:</strong> Choose a planet that
has a technology specialty in a system that contains your units. Destroy
any other player’s units on that planet. Gain trade goods equal to the
planet’s combined resource and influence values and gain 1 technology
that matches the specialty of that planet. Then, purge this card.</p>
<p>Can be used offensively but often just good bonus economy and try to
get a tech you would probably not get from somewhere else.</p>
<h3 id="f.-promissory-note---antivirus">F. Promissory Note -
<strong>Antivirus</strong></h3>
<p>At the start of a combat: Place this card faceup in your play area.
While this card is in your play area, the Nekro player cannot use his
Technological Singularity faction ability against you. If you activate a
system that contains 1 or more of the Nekro player’s units, return this
card to the Nekro player.</p>
<p>You should want a ton for giving this up—you lose so much value by
removing a target from your tech theft options. Usually the person
asking for it is a neighbor. Only sell this once you’ve already
exhausted their tech options, and if they still want to buy it then.</p>
<h3 id="g.-alliance">G. Alliance</h3>
<p>Whoever holds your alliance card has your Commander (Nekro Acidos -
draw 1 action card after gaining a technology).</p>
<p>If you sell this early, it will generate 4-5 action cards for the
holder over the course of the game. Probably 4-5 TG value, but try to
trade up—you’re a scary faction so you can get a top tier alliance as
people want to incentivize you to not attack them.</p>
<h3 id="h.-mech---mordred">H. Mech - <strong>Mordred</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | <strong>Sustain Damage</strong></p>
<p><strong>Special Ability:</strong> During combat against an opponent
who has an “X” or “Y” token on 1 or more of their technologies, apply +2
to the result of each of this unit’s combat rolls.</p>
<p>It’s a punch those who are already down—if you stole their techs your
mechs become even better. Crazy synergy with flagship to have murderous
flying mechs—one of the strongest ships in the game that also fights on
the ground.</p>
<h3 id="i.-flagship---the-alastor">I. Flagship - <strong>The
Alastor</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 8 | Combat: 9 (x2) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 3 | <strong>Sustain
Damage</strong></p>
<p><strong>Special Ability:</strong> At the start of a space combat,
choose any number of your ground forces in this system to participate in
that combat as if they were ships.</p>
<p>Note how the flagship makes it redundant to have fighters—your
infantry are just better fighters that can also be on the ground. Your
flagship, a couple of mechs + some carriers filled with infantry is one
of the strongest fleets in the game, don’t let the hit on 9 fool ya.</p>
<h3 id="j.-breakthrough">J. Breakthrough</h3>
<p><strong>Valefar Assimilator Z (Temporal Entanglement)</strong> - When
you would gain another player’s technology using one of your faction
abilities, you may instead place one of your “Z” assimilator tokens on
that player’s faction sheet. Your flagship gains the text abilities of
that faction’s flagship in addition to its own.</p>
<p>Gives you very little—save resources by not getting it. Unless you
fully understand why you want it for a specific flagship ability, leave
it. Only very few flagships are good targets: Nomad, Naaz, Winnu,
Yssaril, Sardakk, Crimson, Ghosts, Jol-Nar, Mahact, Last Bastion,
Arborec, Naalu, Yin, Barony, Mentak are some potential targets. You have
to consider it costs you a tech and an AC.</p>
<p><strong>Special note:</strong> Fun anti-Ghosts tech to say hello to
their home system.</p>
<h3 id="k.-slice-and-draft-considerations">K. Slice and Draft
Considerations</h3>
<p>Nekro needs access to tech-rich opponents and strong planets for
military production:</p>
<p><strong>Speaker Order:</strong> Can be anywhere. Flexible. Tech-prone
neighbors good.</p>
<p><strong>Slice Priorities:</strong> - <strong>Strong planets
nearby</strong> - Need resources for military production. -
<strong>Resources over influence</strong> - Can’t vote and can get
tokens through resources. - <strong>Primor / Hope’s End</strong> - Helps
early game. Lack of ground forces (only 2 infantry to start). -
<strong>Access to people</strong> - You need to reach opponents for tech
theft.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid:</strong> - <strong>Gravity rifts to neighbors</strong>
- Hard to reach through. - <strong>Asteroid fields to neighbors</strong>
- Blocks access. - <strong>Novas</strong> - Need to have access to
people. - <strong>Entropic Scar</strong> - Useless with Valefar
Assimilators.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iv.-structural-weaknesses">IV. Structural Weaknesses</h2>
<h3 id="a.-first-turn-priorities">A. First Turn Priorities</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1 Priority Rankings:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Scoring</strong> - Super priority. You’re not a fun
target to stop, so stay ahead.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expansion</strong> - Solving your 2 infantry problem.
Expand to be able to reach people and get tech through combat.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology</strong> - Try to make a deal for some early
tech if possible—better than making an early enemy. If Gravity Drive is
on the map, get it ASAP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Breakthrough</strong> - Only for Thunder’s Edge and
screwing with people.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Expansion Notes:</strong> You have to produce and take a few
systems nearby. If you produce through Warfare or Construction, use the
unlocked units to send a spec ops crew to find an early tech—maybe snipe
a destroyer that picked up DET or something. Otherwise you have to walk
it kind of slow. Use your superior token economy to get a head start on
economy.</p>
<h3 id="b.-universal-table-hate">B. Universal Table Hate</h3>
<p>Everyone knows you must attack to gain techs. This makes you the
table’s villain automatically. Expect coordinated opposition, defensive
alliances against you, and constant political targeting. You’re also a
late game beast, so people are not too happy to deal with you early even
if you are nice.</p>
<p>Try to play it smart—keep it even, don’t target one person way more.
Everyone usually has different tech, so it’s good to attack everyone
equally to be fair and for your own gain.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="v.-technology">V. Technology</h2>
<h3 id="a.-overview">A. Overview</h3>
<p>You’re a tech powerhouse—the person who will almost always end up
with the most tech of every type. It will cause diplomatic damage, but
in the end, the singularity will consume all.</p>
<h3 id="b.-technology-stealing-priority">B. Technology Stealing

<h3 id="c.-valefar-assimilator-token-placement">C. Valefar Assimilator
Token Placement</h3>
<p>You have X and Y tokens to place on enemy faction technologies.
Incredibly hard to rate all faction techs that are stealable, but in
general:</p>
<p><strong>Unit upgrades are all good.</strong> Letani 2 (Arborec
infantry upgrade) with flagship is a special type of overpowered.</p>
<p><strong>Notable non-unit upgrade faction techs:</strong> -
<strong>Chaos Mapping (Saar)</strong> - Others can’t activate asteroids
with your ships. Produce 1 unit in systems with PRODUCTION. -
<strong>Mirror Computing (Mentak)</strong> - Each trade good worth 2
resources or influence instead of 1. - <strong>Aetherstream
(Empyrean)</strong> - +1 move for you/neighbors activating adjacent to
anomalies. - <strong>Mageon Implants (Yssaril)</strong> - ACTION: Look
at player’s action cards and steal one. - <strong>Non-Euclidean
Shielding (Barony)</strong> - Sustain Damage cancels 2 hits instead of
1. - <strong>E-res Siphons (Jol-Nar)</strong> - Gain 4 TG when others
activate systems with your ships.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vi.-strategy-cards">VI. Strategy Cards</h2>
<h3 id="a.-round-1">A. Round 1</h3>
<p>Incredibly flexible.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1 Priority Ranking:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Trade</strong> - For making tech deals. Economy always
helpful to max plastic advantage.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership</strong> - To use tons of secondaries.</li>
<li><strong>Construction</strong> - Help out your start and get a head
start on structures.</li>
<li><strong>Technology</strong> - Free if primary so 3 tokens like
Leadership but better if others tech more and you get more tech
later.</li>
<li><strong>Politics</strong> - Agent for money. Speaker for Round 2
plays.</li>
<li><strong>Warfare</strong> - Emergency to fill out slice.</li>
<li><strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Gives more to others than you. You can
afford things without.</li>
<li><strong>Imperial</strong> - Never Round 1.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="b.-round-2">B. Round 2+</h3>
<p><strong>Love:</strong> - <strong>Leadership</strong> - CCs fuel your
constant aggression. Attack every round. - <strong>Warfare</strong> -
You attack every round. Unlocking fleets is critical for sustained
aggression. - <strong>Politics</strong> - Control agendas + Speaker. Use
Agent for political trades. - <strong>Imperial</strong> - Points are
points. Needed rounds 3-5.</p>
<p><strong>Like:</strong> - <strong>Trade</strong> - 3 commodities + TGs
for military funding. - <strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Protect home while
invading opponents. Readying for objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Situational:</strong> - <strong>Technology</strong> - HATE
unless Commander unlocked. Propagation only gives 3 CCs. Take only if
you can follow for 3 CCs + 1 tech after Commander unlock.</p>
<p><strong>Hate:</strong> - <strong>Construction</strong> - Limited
structure needs. Others value this more.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vii.-intermediate">VII. Intermediate</h2>
<h3 id="a.-alastor-flagship-tactics">A. Alastor Flagship Tactics</h3>
<p>Your flagship’s ability (ground forces participate in space combat)
is game-changing:</p>
<p><strong>Optimal Loading:</strong> - 3 infantry on Alastor at all
times - At space combat start, 3 infantry fight as ships - Total combat
dice: 2 flagship (9+) + 3 infantry (8+) = 5 dice - Expected hits per
round: ~1.5 hits</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Tactics:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Infantry Expendability:</strong> Infantry dying in space
combat is acceptable—saves flagship from hits</li>
<li><strong>Mech Integration:</strong> Load 1 mech + 2 infantry. Mech
fights at 6 (or 4 if +2 bonus applies), provides Sustain</li>
<li><strong>Hero Synergy:</strong> Load more ground forces before Hero
activation for overwhelming dice</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Invasion Combo:</strong> - Approach enemy system with Alastor
+ 3 infantry - Declare space combat, ground forces participate - Roll 5
combat dice, destroy enemy fleet - Land surviving ground forces for
invasion - Even if 2 infantry die in space combat, 1 survives for ground
combat + Dacxive spawns 1 more after ground win</p>
<h3 id="b.-technology-singularity-timing">B. Technology Singularity
Timing</h3>
<p>You can steal 1 tech per combat. Maximize value:</p>
<p><strong>Target Selection:</strong> 1. Which ship to kill? Kill ship
from player with most valuable unstolen techs 2. Which tech to steal?
Prioritize unit upgrades &gt; mobility techs &gt; economic techs 3.
Preserve future theft? Don’t eliminate tech-rich opponents early—farm
them for multiple rounds</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> - Fighting Jol-Nar with Carrier II, Cruiser
II, Dreadnought II, Sarween Tools - Round 1: Kill carrier, steal Carrier
II - Round 2: Kill cruiser, steal Cruiser II - Round 3: Kill
dreadnought, steal Dreadnought II - Don’t eliminate Jol-Nar! They’ll
research more techs for you to steal later</p>
<h3 id="c.-galactic-threat-prediction-optimization">C. Galactic Threat
Prediction Optimization</h3>
<p>Once per agenda, predict outcome for free tech if correct:</p>
<p><strong>Prediction Strategy:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Read the Table:</strong> Identify voting coalitions before
agenda phase</li>
<li><strong>Speaker Position:</strong> If you’re Speaker, set agendas
with obvious outcomes</li>
<li><strong>Agent Intel:</strong> Use Agent on key players to gauge
their voting intentions</li>
<li><strong>Safe Predictions:</strong> Predict on law agendas with
strong consensus</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tech Stealing from Predictions:</strong> - If you predict
“For” and it passes, steal from ANY player who voted For - Choose player
with best unstolen techs (usually tech-heavy factions) - This is free
tech gain without combat</p>
<p><strong>Prediction Percentage Goals:</strong> - 50% accuracy: 5 free
techs per game (2 agendas × 5 rounds × 50%) - 70% accuracy: 7 free techs
per game - Combined with combat theft: 15-20 techs total</p>
<h3 id="d.-propagation-economy">D. Propagation Economy</h3>
<p>You cannot research but gain 3 CCs when you would research:</p>
<p><strong>Before Commander:</strong> - Following Technology secondary =
3 CCs - This is mediocre value (Leadership secondary = 2 CCs for 1 less
resource) - Avoid following Tech unless desperate for CCs</p>
<p><strong>After Commander:</strong> - Following Technology secondary =
3 CCs + 1 tech - This is EXCELLENT value (free tech + 3 CCs) - Follow
Tech secondary every round if possible - Prioritize taking
Leadership/Trade to afford following Tech</p>
<p><strong>CC Generation:</strong> - Propagation: +3 CCs per follow -
Galactic Threat: +1 tech per correct agenda prediction (Commander draws

Assimilator Z Breakthrough Strategy</h3>
<p>Your breakthrough lets you copy enemy flagship abilities:</p>
<p><strong>Best Flagship Abilities to Copy:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Saar - Son of Ragh:</strong> Scuttle (destroy for TGs) + AFB
6(x2). Combine with your ground force participation for absurd
dice.</li>
<li><strong>Arborec - Duha Menaimon:</strong> PRODUCTION 5. Your
flagship becomes mobile production.</li>
<li><strong>Nomad - Memoria:</strong> Teleport to mech systems.
Incredible mobility.</li>
<li><strong>Argent - Crimson Hawk:</strong> +1 die in first combat
round. Your Alastor rolls 3 dice at 9+ round 1.</li>
<li><strong>Yin - Van Hauge:</strong> +1 die for each opponent’s
non-fighter ship. Scales in large battles.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Placement Timing:</strong> - Research Valefar Z breakthrough
R3-4 if available - Place Z token on faction with strongest flagship
synergy - Your Alastor gains their text IN ADDITION to ground force
ability - Combined flagship becomes game-winning</p>

challenging with military focus, and cannot vote for political
objectives.</p>

<p>Nekro Virus is the faction for players who love aggressive combat and
tech optimization. You’re not researching technologies—you’re stealing
them. Every battle is a research opportunity, and you’ll end the game
with more technologies than anyone else.</p>
<p>Your biggest strength is technological superiority. You don’t pay for
research, you take it by force. While other factions carefully choose
their tech paths, you steal everything—unit upgrades, faction
technologies, utility techs. Your flagship turns infantry into space
combat powerhouses, making every invasion devastating.</p>
<p>When you master Nekro, you feel like an unstoppable force consuming
the galaxy. The table will hate you, but they can’t stop you from
growing stronger with every combat. Nekro Virus doesn’t discover
technology—they assimilate it, one destroyed ship at a time.</p>
<p><strong>The virus assimilates all.</strong></p>
