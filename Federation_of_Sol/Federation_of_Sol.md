# Federation of Sol Guide

*Art credit: Fantasy Flight Games*

## I. Introduction

The Federation of Sol is TI4's infantry and carrier specialist, humanity's faction built around overwhelming ground forces and exceptional transport capacity. While other factions see ground combat as secondary to space battles, you see it as your primary victory path. With upgraded carriers that cost only 3 resources, infantry that hit on 7, and the ability to drop infantry anywhere via Critical Drop, you're the faction that wins wars through boots on the ground.

Your defining trait is Versatile, which gives you +1 command token during status phase. This seemingly small bonus compounds into significant action economy over a game - you get 7-8 command tokens per round while opponents get 6-7. Combined with Neural Motivator starting tech (refreshes command tokens on secondaries), you have more activations than almost anyone.

The Federation of Sol excels at ground combat superiority, carrier-based expansion, and action economy through command token generation. You start with Neural Motivator and Antimass Deflectors, giving you immediate command token efficiency and movement flexibility. Your faction technologies upgrade your already-strong carriers and infantry. Your commander provides free infantry during defense. You don't win through flashy abilities - you win through having more units in more places with more activations than opponents can match.

## II. Playstyle

The Sol philosophy is controlled aggression through superior numbers and logistics. You want to expand aggressively using your cheap carriers and numerous infantry, claim planets through ground combat superiority, and leverage your extra command tokens to maintain pressure across multiple fronts.

Early game Sol focuses on leveraging your starting advantages. You begin with 5 infantry (most in the game), 2 carriers (excellent transport), and Neural Motivator (command token efficiency). Use your carriers to claim 2-3 systems immediately, depositing infantry to hold planets. Your Advanced Carrier I costs only 3 resources, making fleet expansion affordable.

Mid-game transitions into ground combat dominance and command token advantage. Your Spec Ops I infantry hit on 7 instead of 8, giving you a significant edge in invasions. Your Versatile ability means you're generating 1 extra command token per round, funding additional activations. Use Critical Drop to deploy infantry directly to contested planets, bypassing normal transport limitations.

Late game Sol is about overwhelming production and ground force superiority. Your Advanced Carrier II provides Sustain Damage and 8 capacity, making carriers incredibly resilient. Your Spec Ops II infantry have a 33% chance to return after dying, creating infinite recursion. Your Genesis flagship produces 1 free infantry per round. Your hero clears all your command tokens from the board, enabling massive multi-front assaults in one round.

## III. The Basics

### A. Home System & Commodities

**Home System:** Jord
- 4 resources / 2 influence
- **Total: 4 optimal resources / 2 optimal influence**

**Commodities:** 4

Your home system provides strong resources (4) for production and moderate influence (2). It's a solid economic base that supports your production-heavy strategy.

### B. Starting Fleet
- 2 Carriers (capacity 12 total - these are Advanced Carrier I)
- 1 Destroyer
- 3 Fighters
- 5 Infantry
- 1 Space Dock

You start with more infantry than any other faction (5) and your carriers are already upgraded to Advanced Carrier I with 6 capacity each. This gives you immediate superiority in ground forces and transport.

### C. Starting Tech

**Neural Motivator (Yellow):** During the action phase, after you perform an action, gain 1 command token if you have no command tokens in your strategy pool.

**Antimass Deflectors (Blue):** Ships gain +1 movement when moving through or out of asteroid fields or supernovas.

Neural Motivator is incredible - you can use secondaries freely because you'll regain the strategy pool token immediately. Antimass Deflectors provides movement flexibility.

### D. Faction Abilities

**Critical Drop:** Spend 1 token from your strategy pool to place 2 infantry from your reinforcements on 1 planet you control.

This is orbital drop capability. You can deploy infantry directly to any planet you control (even contested ones) without needing carriers present. This enables defensive reinforcement and surprise ground combat swings.

**Versatile:** When you gain command tokens during the status phase, gain 1 additional command token.

You get +1 command token per round. Over a 7-round game, that's 7 extra activations compared to opponents. This is massive action economy advantage.

### E. Leaders

**Agent - Evelyn DeLouis:** At the start of a ground combat round, you may exhaust this card to choose 1 ground force in the active system. That ground force rolls 1 additional die during this combat round.

Your agent gives +1 die to one ground force per combat round. Use it on your Spec Ops infantry (which hit on 6-7 with upgrade) or mechs for maximum value.

**Commander - Claire Gibson:**
- **Unlock:** Control planets that have a combined total of at least 12 resources
- **Ability:** At the start of a ground combat on a planet you control, you may place 1 infantry from your reinforcements on that planet.

Your commander gives you free defensive infantry whenever opponents invade your planets. This makes you incredibly difficult to invade - every planet defense gets +1 infantry automatically.

**Hero - Jace X, 4th Air Legion:**
- **Unlock:** Have 3 scored objectives
- **Helio Command Array:** Remove each of your command tokens from the game board and return them to your reinforcements. Then, purge this card.

This hero clears all your command tokens from the board, returning them to your pool. This enables massive multi-system activations in one round - potentially activating 8-10 systems in a single action round if you've been spreading tokens across the map.

### F. Promissory Note

**Military Support:** At the start of the Sol player's turn, remove 1 token from the Sol player's strategy pool, if able, and return it to his reinforcements. Then, you may place 2 infantry from your reinforcements on any planet you control. Then, return this card to the Sol player.

This promissory note gives the holder free infantry deployment (like Critical Drop). It's valuable for factions needing ground force support, making your promissory note a strong diplomatic tool.

### G. Alliance

When you activate a system, your ally may spend 1 token from their strategy pool to place 2 infantry from their reinforcements on 1 planet they control in that system. At the start of a ground combat on a planet you or your ally control, you or your ally may place 1 infantry from your or your ally's reinforcements on that planet.

This extends both Critical Drop and your commander's defensive infantry to your ally. They gain your ground combat advantages, creating a powerful military alliance.

### H. Mech

**ZS Thunderbolt M2:** Cost 2, Combat 6, Sustain Damage

**DEPLOY:** After you use your Critical Drop faction ability, you may spend 3 resources to place 1 mech on that planet.

Your mechs can deploy alongside infantry via Critical Drop for 3 additional resources. This enables rapid mech deployment to contested planets without needing carriers.

### I. Flagship

**Genesis:** Cost 8, Combat 5 (x2), Move 1, Capacity 12, Sustain Damage

At the end of the status phase, place 1 infantry from your reinforcements in this system's space area.

Your flagship has massive capacity (12) and generates 1 free infantry per round. The infantry appears in space, requiring a carrier or landing to become useful, but it's free production that compounds over time.

### J. Breakthrough

**Bellum Gloriosum:** Y<>G (Yellow-Green synergy)

When you produce a ship that has capacity, you may also produce any combination of ground forces or fighters up to that ship's capacity. They do not count against your PRODUCTION limit.

This is absurd. When you produce a carrier (capacity 6-8), you can produce 6-8 additional infantry or fighters for free (still pay their cost, but they don't count against production). This enables massive army building in one production cycle.

### K. Slice Considerations

**Must Have:**
- At least 4-5 high-resource planets for production (you'll be building many carriers and infantry)
- Some influence planets (you need influence for politics despite being military-focused)
- Access to Mecatol Rex or key military objectives

**Nice to Have:**
- Yellow tech skips (supports Spec Ops II and breakthrough)
- Green tech skips (supports Spec Ops II and breakthrough)
- Hazardous planets (your Spec Ops are effective at invading these)

**Avoid:**
- Low-resource slices (you're production-heavy and need resources)
- Isolated slices with difficult expansion paths (you want to push outward aggressively)
- Slices without ground combat opportunities (wastes your infantry advantage)

**Speaker Priority:** Medium (3-5th pick)

You're not desperate for early picks but benefit from Leadership or Construction for expansion. Mid-pack is fine.

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

**Space Combat Mediocrity:** You have no space combat bonuses or special abilities. Your carriers hit on 9 (terrible), and you rely on fighters for space combat power. Against dedicated space combat factions, you're outmatched.

**Resource Intensity:** Carriers cost 3, infantry cost 0.5 each, but you're building many of both. You need strong resource economy to sustain your production rate.

**Commander Unlock Threshold:** Requiring 12 resources worth of planets sounds easy but is round 3-4 before you typically unlock. Early aggression can delay this significantly.

**Ground Combat Dependency:** Your strength is ground combat, but you need to win space battles first to land troops. If you can't achieve space superiority, your infantry advantages are wasted.

**Influence Poverty:** Only 2 influence from home system makes you influence-poor. You rely on planet expansion for influence, making politics challenging early.

**Slow Tech Progression:** While you start with 2 techs, both your faction techs require significant prerequisites (Advanced Carrier II needs BB, Spec Ops II needs GG). Tech paths are expensive.

## V. Technology

### A. Starting Technologies

- **Bio-Stims:** 2 infantry production via planet exhaust

**Solid Options:**
- **Fleet Logistics:** Double activation
- **Dreadnought II or Cruiser II:** Space combat capability
- **Hyper Metabolism:** Planet readying for multiple productions

## VI. Strategy Cards

### A. Round 1 Ratings

**Leadership (1):** **Love**. 3 command tokens + Versatile means you get 4 total. Excellent for expansion.

**Diplomacy (2):** **Bad**. You're aggressive, not defensive. Diplomacy conflicts with your playstyle.

**Politics (3):** **Moderate**. Only 2 home influence makes politics weaker for you than most.

**Construction (4):** **Good**. Extra space dock or PDS supports expansion and production.

**Trade (5):** **Good**. 4 commodities makes Trade solid economic value.

**Warfare (6):** **Like**. Fleet token return is valuable; secondary gives redistributes tokens efficiently.

**Technology (7):** **Like**. You need Advanced Carrier II and Spec Ops II; Technology accelerates this.

**Imperial (8):** **Great**. Points are the goal; you can hold objectives with infantry superiority.

### B. General Strategy Card Priority

**Early Game (Rounds 1-2):**
Leadership > Technology > Construction > Trade

**Mid Game (Rounds 3-4):**
Imperial > Leadership > Technology > Warfare

**Late Game (Rounds 5+):**
Imperial > Leadership > Warfare > Politics

## VII. Intermediate

### A. Unit Composition

**Early Game (Rounds 1-3):**
- Core: 3-4 Carriers (Advanced Carrier I), 1-2 Destroyers, 0-1 Cruisers
- Screen: 4-6 Fighters
- Ground: 10-15 Infantry (Spec Ops I), 0-1 Mechs
- Support: 1-2 Space Docks, 1-2 PDS

**Mid Game (Rounds 3-5):**
- Core: 5-6 Carriers (transitioning to Advanced Carrier II), 2-3 Destroyers, 1-2 Cruisers
- Screen: 8-12 Fighters
- Ground: 18-25 Infantry (Spec Ops I/II), 1-2 Mechs
- Support: 2 Space Docks, 2-3 PDS
- Special: Genesis flagship if affordable

**Late Game (Rounds 5+):**
- Core: 6-8 Carriers (Advanced Carrier II), 3-4 Destroyers/Cruisers, 1-2 Dreadnoughts
- Screen: 12-16 Fighters
- Ground: 25-35 Infantry (Spec Ops II), 2-3 Mechs
- Support: 2-3 Space Docks, 3-4 PDS
- Special: Genesis flagship producing free infantry

**Notes:**
- Carriers are your core unit; build more carriers than any other faction
- Infantry count should be 2-3x higher than other factions
- Don't over-invest in expensive ships; your strength is numbers, not quality
- Flagship's free infantry compounds over time; build it by round 4-5 if possible

### B. Point Planning

**Christmas Land Scoring (10-point game):**

| Round | Public | Secret | MR | Bonus | Total | Cumulative |
|-------|--------|--------|-----|-------|-------|------------|
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 3 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 4 |
| 5 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 6 |
| 6 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 8 |
| 7 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 10 |

**Notes:**
- Round 2: Score planet control or resource objective (your expansion is strong)
- Round 3: Commander unlocks; score ground combat or infantry secret
- Round 4: Continue public progression
- Round 5-6: Hold Mecatol with overwhelming infantry garrison
- Round 7: Second secret (likely ground combat related) for victory

### C. Game Plan

**Carrier Swarm Strategy:**

Your primary game plan revolves around building many Advanced Carriers and filling them with infantry for rapid expansion.

**Round 1-2:** Build 2-3 additional carriers using your space dock. Each carrier costs only 3 resources and holds 6 infantry. Use these carriers to claim 3-4 systems rapidly, depositing infantry garrisons on valuable planets.

**Round 3-4:** Research Advanced Carrier II if possible. Now your carriers have Sustain Damage and 8 capacity. This makes them incredibly resilient transports that can survive combat while carrying massive infantry armies. Continue expansion.

**Round 5+:** You should have 6-8 carriers by now, each holding 6-8 infantry. This gives you 48-64 infantry distributed across the map. Use Critical Drop to reinforce contested planets. Use your commander's defensive infantry to make invasions costly. Your hero can clear tokens for multi-front assault.

**Critical Drop Tactical Use:**

Your Critical Drop ability (spend strategy token to place 2 infantry on a planet you control) has multiple applications:
1. **Defensive Reinforcement:** Enemy threatens invasion? Drop 2 infantry before they land.
2. **Ground Combat Swing:** During invasion, drop 2 infantry mid-combat for overwhelming numbers.
3. **Rapid Garrison:** Just captured a planet? Drop 2 infantry to secure it immediately.

The limitation is it costs a strategy pool token, which with Neural Motivator you'll regain, but timing matters.

**Commander Defense Strategy:**

Once Claire Gibson unlocks (12 resources worth of planets), every planet you control gets +1 free infantry when invaded. This makes you incredibly difficult to attack:
- Opponent invades with 4 infantry? You defend with your garrison + 1 free infantry.
- Multiple invasions? Every planet gets +1 infantry.

Combined with Critical Drop, you can defend planets with 3+ additional infantry beyond what's already there.

**Bellum Gloriosum Production:**

Your breakthrough lets you produce ground forces/fighters up to capacity without counting against production when producing capacity ships. Example:
- Produce 1 Advanced Carrier II (capacity 8) = use 1 production
- Also produce 8 Spec Ops infantry = uses 0 additional production
- Total: 1 carrier + 8 infantry using only 1 production value

With PRODUCTION 5 space dock, you can produce 5 carriers + 40 infantry in one activation. This is absurd army building.

## IX. Alliance Priority

**Best Alliance Partners:**

1. **Xxcha Kingdom:** Defensive faction values your Military Support PN; you benefit from their defensive PDS network

2. **Arborec:** Your infantry production synergizes with their space-taking infantry; combined ground superiority

3. **Winnu:** Weak faction benefits from your military support; you benefit from their Mecatol focus

4. **Yssaril:** Political faction provides influence you lack; you provide military muscle

5. **Naalu:** Mobile faction benefits from your garrison support; you benefit from their initiative control

**Worst Alliance Partners:**

1. **L1Z1X Mindnet:** Another aggressive military faction; redundant strengths create competition

2. **Sardakk N'orr:** Combat faction doesn't provide what you need; overlapping military focus

3. **Mentak Coalition:** Pirates don't synergize with your production-heavy style

## X. End Notes

Federation of Sol is the faction for players who love combined arms warfare, logistics management, and overwhelming force. You're not the flashiest faction - no teleportation, no instant-win abilities, no game-breaking combos. You're the faction that simply has more infantry, more carriers, and more activations than opponents can match.

The key to mastering Sol is understanding that quantity is a quality all its own. Your carriers cost 3 resources. Your infantry hit on 7. You get +1 command token per round. These small advantages compound into overwhelming superiority over 6-7 rounds.

Your biggest strength is sustainability. Other factions spike in power then fade. You build momentum that accelerates. Every round you control more planets, produce more units, and have more activations. By round 5, you're an unstoppable force that owns half the galaxy's ground territory.

When you nail Sol, you feel like a military industrial complex conquering the galaxy through sheer production and logistics. Your carriers swarm across the map like locusts. Your infantry garrison every valuable planet. Your commander makes you impossible to invade. Your hero enables devastating multi-front assaults.

Federation of Sol doesn't conquer the galaxy through tricks - they conquer it through boots on the ground, carriers in the sky, and more command tokens than anyone else. And when victory comes, it's because you controlled more planets with more troops executing more activations than opponents could possibly counter.
