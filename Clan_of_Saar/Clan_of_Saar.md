# The Clan of Saar Comprehensive Strategy Guide

## I. Introduction

The Clan of Saar are Twilight Imperium's **mobile production masters**, the only faction whose space docks float in space, move like ships, and produce without controlling planets. Your unique Floating Factories (space docks with movement, capacity, and the ability to retreat) break fundamental TI4 rules: you don't need planets for production, you can relocate your infrastructure instantly, and your Nomadic ability lets you score objectives even if you abandon your home system entirely. You start with Antimass Deflectors (free movement boost), field 2 carriers for early mobility, and leverage Scavenge (gain 1 trade good per planet conquered) for economic acceleration. This faction rewards aggressive expansion, positional flexibility, and understanding when to float your factories forward versus when to consolidate. No faction matches Saar's ability to project production anywhere on the map.

## II. Playstyle

**Early Game (Rounds 1-2):**
Your opening focuses on leveraging your mobile Floating Factory to claim high-value systems without traditional planet control. Move your starting space dock (Floating Factory I) to a resource-rich system (3-4 resources) and produce ships directly in space, bypassing the need to control planets. Your Scavenge ability generates 1 trade good every time you conquer a planet, creating economic snowball when combined with aggressive expansion. Start with Antimass Deflectors (0-cost tech, grants +1 movement to ships with capacity), giving your 2 starting carriers movement 2 immediately. This mobility lets you reach distant high-value systems Round 1. Your Nomadic ability means you can abandon your home system (Lisis II + Ragh) without penalty—as long as you score objectives, home control is irrelevant. Expand aggressively: conquer 3-4 planets Round 1-2 to trigger Scavenge repeatedly.

**Mid Game (Rounds 3-4):**
This is when Saar's mobile production dominates. Your commander (Rowl Sarring) unlocks with 3 space docks on board, granting the ability to place fighters/infantry at ANY non-blockaded space dock when producing them. Combined with 2-3 Floating Factories positioned strategically, you can produce infantry at one space dock and deploy them instantly at another across the map. Research Floating Factory II (2 yellow prerequisites) to upgrade your space docks to movement 2, capacity 5, and production 7—incredible infrastructure units. Your Chaos Mapping faction tech (1 blue prerequisite) prevents opponents from activating asteroid fields containing your ships AND lets you produce 1 unit at start of turn in any system with your production units. Build 2-3 Floating Factories total, positioning them near contested areas (Mecatol, opponent slices, objective-relevant systems). Your hero (Gurno Aggero) unlocks Round 3-4, allowing you to destroy all enemy infantry/fighters in a system adjacent to your space dock—devastating area denial.

**Late Game (Rounds 5-6+):**
Your late-game strength is **production omnipresence and objective flexibility**. With 3-4 Floating Factory IIs (move 2 each), you can reposition entire production hubs in one action, responding to objectives instantly. Your Deorbit Barrage breakthrough (blue/red) lets you spend resources to bombard planets up to 2 systems away from asteroids containing your ships—long-range bombardment without needing to invade. Your flagship (Son of Ragh) has Anti-Fighter Barrage 6 x4, shredding fighter screens, and capacity 3 for ground force transport. Your mech (Scavenger Zeta) has DEPLOY ability: after conquering a planet, spend 1 trade good to place a mech there immediately, turning Scavenge trade goods into instant mechs. Victory comes from **scoring objectives through mobile production**, conquering planets for Scavenge trade goods, and leveraging commander + multiple factories to overwhelm opponents with distributed fleets.

## III. The Basics

### A. Home System & Commodities

**Lisis II (Home System):** 1 resource, 0 influence
- Minimal economic contribution
- 1 resource barely supports production
- 0 influence makes early politics weak

**Ragh (Home System):** 2 resources, 1 influence
- Slightly better economic planet
- 2 resources helps early builds
- 1 influence provides minimal political power

**Total Home System:** 3 resources, 1 influence
- Very weak home economy (tied for worst in game)
- 1 influence is terrible for agenda phases
- You DESPERATELY need expansion for resources/influence

**Commodities:** 3
- Average commodity economy
- Scavenge supplements income (1 trade good per planet conquered)
- Trade actively to convert commodities into trade goods

**Optimal Resource/Influence from Home Worlds:**
- Lisis II: 1 optimal resource / 0 optimal influence
- Ragh: 2 optimal resources / 1 optimal influence
- Total: 3 optimal resources / 1 optimal influence
- Among the weakest home systems economically
- Nomadic ability compensates by allowing home abandonment

### B. Starting Fleet

**2 Carriers:**
- Standard capacity 6 carriers
- Critical for transporting infantry and Floating Factory
- With Antimass Deflectors (starting tech), move 2 (instead of 1)
- Enables Round 1 reach to distant high-value systems

**1 Cruiser:**
- Standard cruiser (cost 2, combat 7, move 2)
- Fast screening unit
- With Antimass Deflectors, move 3
- Scouting and early combat support

**2 Fighters:**
- Standard space combat fodder
- Screening units
- Less critical than carriers for your strategy

**4 Infantry:**
- Standard ground force complement
- Adequate for early planet conquests
- Scavenge generates trade goods when conquering with these

**1 Space Dock (Floating Factory I):**
- **Your unique space dock**
- **Move 1** (can move like a ship)
- **Capacity 4** (can transport units like a carrier)
- **Production 5**
- **Placed in space area** (not on planet)
- **Can retreat** from combat like a ship
- **If blockaded, it is destroyed** (critical weakness)
- This is THE defining unit—treat it like a mobile production platform

### C. Starting Tech

**Antimass Deflectors (0-Cost - Blue):**
*Your ships can move into and through asteroid fields. When you move a ship, you may move it through 1 system that contains another player's ships without resolving space combat.*

- **0-cost technology** (doesn't count as prerequisite for most techs)
- +1 movement capacity for ships (your carriers move 2, cruiser moves 3)
- Can move through asteroid fields
- Can move through opponent ships without combat (if ship has capacity)
- Essential early mobility boost
- Opens blue technology path

### D. Faction Abilities

**Scavenge:**
*After you gain control of a planet, gain 1 trade good.*

- Triggers EVERY time you conquer a planet
- Gain 1 trade good per planet
- Economic snowball: conquer 5 planets = 5 trade goods
- Encourages aggressive expansion
- Trade goods fund technologies, units, or mech DEPLOY ability
- Stacks with other conquest bonuses

**Nomadic:**
*You can score objectives even if you do not control the planets in your home system.*

- Can abandon home system without penalty
- Allows floating your home space dock to better positions
- Removes defensive obligation to home
- Unique among all factions (only Saar can ignore home)
- Enables ultra-aggressive forward positioning
- Home planets still provide resources/influence if controlled, but not required

### E. Leaders

**Agent: Captain Mendosa**
*After a player activates a system: You may exhaust this card to increase the move value of 1 of that player's ships to match the move value of the ship on the game board that has the highest move value.*

- Exhausts after ANY player activates a system
- Increase 1 ship's movement to match highest ship on board
- Example: Highest ship on board is move 4 → target ship becomes move 4 for that activation
- Works on your ships OR other players' ships (trading tool)
- Enables incredible reach: move 1 dreadnought → move 4 dreadnought
- High transaction value: offer to allies for support
- Can help Floating Factories reach distant systems (if a move-4 ship exists)

**Commander: Rowl Sarring**
*Unlock: Have 3 space docks on the game board.*
*When you produce fighters or infantry: You may place each of those units at any of your space docks that are not blockaded.*

- Unlock: 3 space docks on board (easy with Floating Factories)
- When producing fighters OR infantry, place them at ANY non-blockaded space dock
- Example: Produce 4 infantry at Factory A → place 2 at Factory A, 1 at Factory B, 1 at Factory C
- Incredible strategic flexibility
- Enables instant ground force reinforcement across the map
- Synergizes with multiple Floating Factories positioned strategically
- Unlock Round 2-3 by building 2 additional Floating Factories

**Hero: Gurno Aggero**
*Unlock: Have 3 scored objectives.*
*Armageddon Relay:*
*ACTION: Choose 1 system that is adjacent to 1 of your space docks. Destroy all other players' infantry and fighters in that system. Then, purge this card.*

- One-time-use ability
- Choose 1 system adjacent to ANY of your space docks
- Destroy ALL enemy infantry and fighters in that system
- Does NOT destroy your own units
- Does NOT destroy ships (only infantry/fighters)
- Applications:
  - Clear Mecatol Rex defenders before invasion
  - Wipe out opponent ground forces on contested planets
  - Destroy fighter screens in space combat systems
- Position Floating Factories adjacent to target systems to enable hero usage
- Use Round 4-5 for critical objective scoring or Mecatol conquest

### F. Promissory Note

**Ragh's Call:**
*After you commit 1 or more units to land on a planet: Remove all of the Saar player's ground forces from that planet and place them on a planet controlled by the Saar player. Then, return this card to the Saar player.*

- Holder uses after committing units to land on a planet
- ALL Saar ground forces on that planet are removed
- Saar player places them on a planet they control
- Card returns to Saar after use
- Prevents Saar from defending that planet
- Moderate transaction value: useful for opponents invading Saar-held planets
- Trade for significant support (Saar doesn't heavily defend planets anyway due to Nomadic)

### G. Alliance

**Alliance Ability:**
*While you are neighbors with the Saar player, you gain the following alliance ability:*
*Scavenge - After you gain control of a planet, gain 1 trade good.*

- Grants Scavenge ability to ally
- Neighbor must control or have units in systems adjacent to Saar units/controlled systems
- Moderate value: 1 trade good per planet conquered
- Best for aggressive expansion factions (Barony, L1Z1X, Sardakk)
- Encourages ally to conquer planets frequently

### H. Mech

**Scavenger Zeta:**
*Cost: 2*
*Combat: 6*
*Sustain Damage*
*DEPLOY: After you gain control of a planet, you may spend 1 trade good to place 1 mech on that planet.*

- Standard mech combat 6 with Sustain Damage
- **DEPLOY ability**: After conquering a planet, spend 1 trade good to place this mech there
- Synergizes with Scavenge: conquer planet → gain 1 trade good → spend it to deploy mech
- Net cost: 0 trade goods (Scavenge refunds the DEPLOY cost)
- Enables instant mech deployment without production
- Build 2-3 mechs and keep in reinforcements
- Conquer planet → immediately deploy mech for defense/sustain damage

### I. Flagship

**Son of Ragh:**
*Cost: 8*
*Combat: 5 (x2)*
*Move: 1*
*Capacity: 3*
*Sustain Damage*
*ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE 6 (x4)*

- 2 dice at combat 5 (solid firepower)
- **Anti-Fighter Barrage 6 x4**: Rolls 4 dice at AFB 6 before combat
- Shreds fighter screens (average 2 fighters destroyed per AFB round)
- Capacity 3 for ground force transport
- Movement 1 (slow, but Antimass Deflectors doesn't affect flagships without capacity in base rules)
- Strong anti-fighter flagship, weaker against capital ships

### J. Breakthrough

**Deorbit Barrage (Blue <> Red):**
*ACTION: Exhaust this card and spend any amount of resources to choose a planet up to 2 systems away from an asteroid field that contains your ships; roll a number of dice equal to the amount spent and assign 1 hit to a ground force on that planet for each roll of 4 or greater.*

- Action to exhaust this card
- Spend any amount of resources
- Target: Planet up to 2 systems away from asteroid field with your ships
- Roll dice equal to resources spent
- Each 4+ = 1 hit assigned to ground force on that planet
- Long-range bombardment without invading
- Requires asteroid field positioning
- Requires blue + red prerequisites
- Late-game bombardment tool

### K. Slice Considerations

**Critical Priorities:**

1. **High Resources:**
   - You start with 3 resources from home (very weak)
   - Need 12-15 resources from slice for viability
   - Your Floating Factories need resources to produce
   - Industrial planets (blue tech specialty) support Floating Factory II path

2. **Influence:**
   - You start with only 1 influence (terrible)
   - Need influence-rich planets for politics
   - Cultural planets support influence objectives
   - 8-10 influence from slice minimum

3. **Mobile Positioning:**
   - Avoid corner positions (limits Floating Factory mobility)
   - Equidistant positions maximize relocation flexibility
   - Proximity to multiple opponents enables Scavenge conquest

4. **Technology Specialties:**
   - Industrial (blue) for Floating Factory II path
   - Cybernetic (yellow) for Floating Factory II (requires 2 yellow)
   - Hazardous (red) for Deorbit Barrage breakthrough

**Ideal Slice Characteristics:**
- 12-15 resources, 8-10 influence (after home)
- 2-3 industrial/cybernetic technology specialties
- Equidistant positioning (not corner)
- Moderate Mecatol proximity (you can float factories to it)

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

**1. Floating Factory Vulnerability:**
Your space docks can be destroyed in combat. If blockaded (enemy ships in system with your Floating Factory), the factory is destroyed immediately. This is catastrophic: losing a Floating Factory loses production capacity AND the factory itself (cost 4-6 to rebuild). You must protect factories with fleets or retreat them from contested systems.

**2. Weak Starting Economy:**
With 3/1 from home and 3 commodities, you have one of the weakest starting economies in the game. Early rounds require aggressive Scavenge conquests to acquire trade goods for funding. Without conquest, you cannot afford technologies or large builds.

**3. Commander Dependency:**
Your commander (place fighters/infantry at any space dock) requires 3 space docks on board. Building 2 additional Floating Factories costs 8 resources (4 each) before unlocking commander. If you cannot afford this investment early (Rounds 2-3), your commander unlock delays, and you lose distributed production.

**4. Nomadic Paradox:**
While Nomadic allows abandoning home, you still need resources from somewhere. If you float factories forward and lose home planets without capturing replacements, you may end up resource-starved with no production capacity. Balancing home abandonment vs. economic security is tricky.

**5. Antimass Deflectors Limitation:**
Your starting tech is 0-cost, meaning it does NOT count as a prerequisite for most technologies. To research technologies requiring "1 blue," you must research another blue tech (Gravity Drive, Fleet Logistics, etc.), delaying your tech path compared to factions with normal starting techs.

**6. Influence Poverty:**
With only 1 starting influence, you're one of the weakest factions in early politics. You cannot spend influence for objectives, vote meaningfully in agendas, or compete with influence-rich factions (Xxcha, Hacan, Winnu) until you expand to influence planets.

**7. Scavenge Requires Conquest:**
Your economic engine (Scavenge) only triggers when conquering planets. Against defensive opponents or in peaceful metagames, you cannot generate Scavenge trade goods. Peaceful games starve Saar of their primary economic advantage.

**8. Factory Positioning Risk:**
Floating Factories must be positioned aggressively to maximize production reach, but this exposes them to enemy fleets. Conservative factory placement (deep in your territory) wastes their mobility; aggressive placement (near frontlines) risks destruction. Balancing risk vs. reward is constant.

## V. Technology

- +1 movement for ships with capacity (carriers move 2)
- Move through asteroids
- Move through opponent ships without combat (if capacity ship)
- Opens blue technology path
- Does NOT count as prerequisite for technologies requiring "blue"

### B. Technology Paths

**Primary Path (Floating Factory II Focus):**

Round 1: **Antimass Deflectors (starting)**

Round 2-3: **Sarween Tools (Yellow) OR Hyper Metabolism (Yellow)**
- Sarween Tools: +1 fighter/infantry per production (economic efficiency)
- Hyper Metabolism: +1 command token per status phase (sustainability)
- Need 2 yellow prerequisites for Floating Factory II

Round 3-4: **Floating Factory II (2 Yellow Prerequisites)**

- Better for mass troop transport

Round 4: **Sarween Tools (Yellow)**
- Economic efficiency

Round 5: **Floating Factory II (2 Yellow)**
- Space dock upgrade

### C. Key Technologies

**Floating Factory II (2 Yellow Prerequisites - Faction Tech):**
*Saar Space Dock: Move 2, Capacity 5, PRODUCTION 7. This unit is placed in a space area instead of on a planet. This unit can move and retreat as if it were a ship. If this unit is blockaded, it is destroyed.*

- Upgrade from Floating Factory I
- **Move 2** (dramatically increased mobility)
- **Capacity 5** (can transport 5 units)
- **Production 7** (massive production boost from 5 → 7)
- Essential mid-game technology
- Requires 2 yellow prerequisites (Sarween Tools + Hyper Metabolism/Neural Motivator)

**Chaos Mapping (1 Blue Prerequisite - Faction Tech):**
*Other players cannot activate asteroid fields that contain 1 or more of your ships. At the start of your turn during the action phase, you may produce 1 unit in a system that contains at least 1 of your units that has PRODUCTION.*

- Prevents opponents from activating asteroids with your ships
- Area denial tool (control asteroids to block opponents)
- **At start of turn, produce 1 unit** in system with your production units
- Free production: +1 fighter/infantry per turn without spending resources
- Synergizes with multiple Floating Factories (produce 1 unit at each)
- Requires 1 blue prerequisite (Gravity Drive, Fleet Logistics, etc.)

**Sarween Tools (Yellow):**
*When 1 or more of your units use PRODUCTION, that unit produces 1 additional hit; that hit must be used to produce fighters or infantry.*

- +1 free fighter or infantry per production
- Economic efficiency
- Stacks with Chaos Mapping for 2 free infantry per turn

**Gravity Drive (Blue):**
*Your ships gain +1 movement.*

- +1 movement for ALL ships
- Carriers move 3 (base 1 + Antimass +1 + Gravity +1)
- Cruisers move 4
- Floating Factories move 2 (base 1 + Gravity +1) if researched before Floating Factory II upgrade
- Essential mobility technology

**Carrier II (2 Blue Prerequisites):**
*Cost: 3, Combat: 9, Move: 2 (3 with Antimass), Capacity: 8, Sustain Damage*

- Massive capacity increase (6 → 8)
- Better combat value
- Movement 3 with Antimass Deflectors
- Essential for mass troop transport

## VI. Strategy Cards

### A. Round 1 Ratings

**Leadership (1):** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ - High Value
Command tokens for aggressive expansion. Floating Factory mobility requires tokens. Secondary is excellent.

**Diplomacy (2):** ⭐⭐ - Low Value
Planet readying less critical (Nomadic lets you abandon home). Skip unless defending specific planets.

**Politics (3):** ⭐⭐ - Low Value
Only 1 starting influence makes politics weak. Speaker token okay, but not priority.

**Construction (4):** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Maximum Value
You need multiple Floating Factories (build space docks). Each factory costs 4. Construction is essential. Top-tier Round 1.

**Trade (5):** ⭐⭐⭐ - Moderate Value
3 commodities is average. Scavenge supplements income. Trade refreshes commodities. Secondary acceptable.

**Warfare (6):** ⭐⭐⭐ - Moderate Value
Remove tokens, redistribute fleets. Useful for aggressive play but not critical Round 1.

**Technology (7):** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Maximum Value
You need Floating Factory II (2 yellow), Chaos Mapping (blue), and unit upgrades. Tech path is critical. Top-tier Round 1.

**Imperial (8):** ⭐⭐⭐ - Moderate Value
Scoring Round 1 is nice if objectives available. Otherwise, skip for more aggressive picks.

### B. General Strategy Card Priority

**Rounds 2-3:**
- **Construction (4):** Build 2nd-3rd Floating Factories for commander unlock
- **Technology (7):** Push toward Floating Factory II, Chaos Mapping
- **Leadership (1):** Command token replenishment for factory movement
- **Warfare (6):** If conquering for Scavenge

**Rounds 4-5:**
- **Technology (7):** Complete Floating Factory II, Chaos Mapping
- **Imperial (8):** Scoring objectives
- **Construction (4):** If need additional factories
- **Warfare (6):** Multi-front expansion

**Round 6+:**
- **Imperial (8):** Score to close out game
- **Warfare (6):** Tactical flexibility, factory repositioning
- **Leadership (1):** Command token management

## VII. Intermediate

### A. Unit Composition

**Early Game Fleet (Rounds 1-2):**
- 2-3 Carriers (transport infantry + Floating Factory)
- 2-3 Cruisers (fast screening, scouting)
- 4-6 Fighters (screening)
- 8-12 Infantry (conquest for Scavenge)
- 2 Floating Factories (starting + 1 built Round 1-2)
- 0-1 PDS (low priority)

**Mid Game Fleet (Rounds 3-4):**
- 3-4 Carriers (mass transport)
- 4-6 Cruisers (screening, fast movement)
- 6-8 Fighters (screening)
- 12-16 Infantry (sustained conquest)
- 3 Floating Factories (commander unlock)
- 1-2 PDS (optional)
- 1 Flagship (anti-fighter dominance)

**Late Game Fleet (Rounds 5-6+):**
- 4-5 Carriers (Carrier II if researched)
- 6-8 Cruisers
- 8-10 Fighters
- 16-20 Infantry
- 3-4 Floating Factory IIs (move 2, production 7 each)
- 2-3 PDS (defensive coverage)
- 1 Flagship
- 2-4 Mechs (DEPLOY via Scavenge)

**Key Principles:**
- **Floating Factories are your capital ships**: Protect them like flagships
- Carriers transport factories and infantry
- Cruisers for speed and screening
- Commander + 3 factories = distributed fighter/infantry production
- Mechs deployed instantly via Scavenge trade goods

### B. Point Planning

**"Christmas Land" Scoring Table:**

| Round | Public Objective 1 | Public Objective 2 | Secret Objective | Mecatol/Other | Total Points | Running Total |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 | Control 6 Planets (1) | - | - | - | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | Spend 3 Resources (1) | 3 Ships in Non-Home (1) | Exploring Borders (1) | - | 3 | 4 |
| 3 | 6 Technologies (1) | Control 3 Industrial (1) | - | Mecatol (1) | 3 | 7 |
| 4 | Spend 8 Resources (2) | 5+ Technologies (2) | Win vs 3+ Ships (1) | - | 5 | 12 |
| 5 | - | - | - | Imperial Point (1) | 1 | 13 |
| 6 | Control 11 Planets (2) | 3 Unit Upgrades (2) | - | Support Throne (1) | 5 | 18 |

This scenario shows Saar leveraging mobile production for territorial objectives, Scavenge economy for resource-spend objectives, and tech-heavy path to reach 18+ points.

- **Commander Usage:** Produce infantry at Factory A, place them at Factories B and C for multi-front invasions

**Round 5:**
- **Strategy Card:** Imperial (8) or Warfare (6)
- **Objectives:** Score Stage II objectives, use hero for critical area denial
- **Hero Usage:** Gurno Aggero destroys all infantry/fighters adjacent to factory (clear Mecatol defenders OR wipe opponent ground forces)
- **Tech:** Chaos Mapping (free production at start of turn)
- **Scavenge:** Continue conquests to stockpile trade goods (10-15 total)

**Round 6+:**
- **Endgame:** Convert mobile production into final points
- **Imperial:** Hold Mecatol for scoring
- **Factory Mobility:** Reposition factories to score territorial objectives instantly
- **Mech DEPLOY:** Use Scavenge trade goods to deploy mechs on conquered planets for defense

**Legend:** 🟢 Likely | 🟡 Possible | 🔴 Difficult

Clan of Saar excel at territorial control through mobile production. Scavenge economy enables trade good objectives.

## IX. Alliance Priority

Your alliance ability (granting Scavenge to ally) is **moderately powerful** and best traded to aggressive conquest factions.

**High-Value Alliance Partners:**

1. **Aggressive Expansion Factions:**
   - **L1Z1X Mindnet:** Conquest-focused; Scavenge amplifies their expansion economy
   - **Barony of Letnev:** Dreadnought invasions; benefits from Scavenge TGs
   - **Sardakk N'orr:** Combat-focused; conquers many planets
   - **Sol Federation:** Expansion-heavy; Scavenge accelerates their economy

2. **Trade-Goods-Hungry Factions:**
   - **Jol-Nar:** Need TGs for technology research
   - **Xxcha:** Benefit from TG income for technologies
   - **Nomad:** TG-based economy synergizes with Scavenge

**Low-Value Alliance Partners:**

- **Hacan:** Trade faction; don't need Scavenge TGs
- **Winnu:** Weak military; won't conquer many planets
- **Ghosts of Creuss:** Don't conquer as heavily

**What to Demand in Exchange:**

- **Economic Support:** Trade goods, commodities (you have 3 commodities + Scavenge)
- **Political Support:** Votes on agendas (you have 1 influence)
- **Territory Agreements:** Non-aggression pacts, shared Mecatol control
- **Agent Trades:** Offer Captain Mendosa for high-move ships in exchange for support

**Timing Considerations:**

- Early alliance (Rounds 1-2): Secures non-aggression, helps conquest plans
- Mid alliance (Rounds 3-4): Enables joint Mecatol conquest or shared objectives
- Late alliance (Rounds 5-6): Avoid empowering competitors; only if necessary

## X. End Notes

The Clan of Saar are Twilight Imperium's **mobile production masters**, fundamentally rewriting the rules of infrastructure and expansion. Your success depends on **protecting Floating Factories, leveraging Scavenge for economic snowball, and using mobility to score objectives before opponents can react**.

**Key Principles for Success:**

1. **Protect Your Floating Factories:** They are vulnerable to blockades and combat. Retreat them when threatened; losing a factory is catastrophic.

2. **Build 3 Factories Early:** Unlock commander (Rowl Sarring) by Round 2-3 with 3 space docks. Distributed production is game-changing.

3. **Scavenge Aggressively:** Every planet conquered = 1 trade good. Conquer 10 planets = 10 trade goods. This funds technologies, units, and mech DEPLOYs.

4. **Leverage Nomadic:** Don't defend your home system if it's not strategically valuable. Float factories to better positions; Nomadic lets you abandon home without penalty.

5. **Research Floating Factory II ASAP:** Move 2, Production 7 factories are essential. Prioritize this by Round 3-4.

6. **Commander + Multiple Factories:** Produce infantry at Factory A, place them at Factories B and C instantly for multi-front invasions.

7. **Chaos Mapping Free Production:** Produce 1 free unit per turn at each production unit. With 3 factories, that's 3 free infantry/fighters per turn.

8. **Hero for Critical Denial:** Gurno Aggero destroys all infantry/fighters adjacent to your factory. Clear Mecatol defenders or wipe opponent armies.

9. **Mech DEPLOY Synergy:** Scavenge generates TGs; spend them to DEPLOY mechs instantly on conquered planets.

10. **Factory Positioning:** Position factories near objectives, Mecatol, and contested areas. Move them 2 spaces per activation with Floating Factory II.

Clan of Saar rewards **strategic positioning, factory management, and aggressive conquest**. Your mobile production breaks traditional TI4 rules, enabling you to score objectives and produce fleets in ways no other faction can match. Master factory protection, Scavenge economy, and commander utilization to dominate through superior flexibility.

**The Clan roams the stars. Production knows no borders.**
