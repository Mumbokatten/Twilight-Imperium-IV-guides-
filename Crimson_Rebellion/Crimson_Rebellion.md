# Crimson Rebellion Guide

*Art credit: Fantasy Flight Games (Thunder's Edge)*

## I. Introduction

The Crimson Rebellion is TI4's breach specialists, masters of creating temporary wormhole-like connections across the galaxy. While other factions rely on traditional movement, you bend space itself through breach tokens, creating unexpected adjacencies that allow you to strike anywhere, anytime. You're the faction that turns the map into a spiderweb of potential connections, threatening multiple fronts simultaneously while remaining frustratingly hard to pin down.

Your defining trait is the breach mechanic combined with the Sundered ability. You can't use normal wormholes (they're how you were exiled in the first place), but you create your own network through breach tokens. These breaches make systems adjacent to each other, allowing you to move vast distances in a single activation. Combined with your home system's defensive ability that destroys enemy units that enter it, you're a faction built around controlling space and time.

The Crimson Rebellion excels at surgical strikes, economic harassment, and objective flexibility. Your Subatomic Splicer technology lets you rebuild destroyed ships at your home system, making you incredibly resilient. Your commander generates income from combat, turning aggression into economy. You're not the strongest militarily, but you're the most unpredictable and adaptive.

## II. Playstyle

The Crimson philosophy is strategic positioning through breach network creation. You want to identify key systems across the board and link them with breaches, creating a web of adjacencies that only you can exploit effectively. This gives you threat projection far beyond what your fleet size suggests.

Early game Crimson focuses on exploration and initial breach placement. Your starting dreadnought and destroyer provide solid combat capability, and your 2 PDS give you defensive options. You want to establish 2-3 breach locations by round 2, creating lanes for economic expansion and objective scoring.

Mid-game transitions into aggressive breach exploitation. With your Resonance Generator breakthrough active, you gain +1 movement from your home system and breach locations, allowing you to cover massive distances. Your commander should unlock around round 3-4, converting your combat actions into economic gains. This is when you leverage your unpredictability to score objectives while opponents struggle to defend multiple vectors.

Late game Crimson is about breach network dominance and Subatomic Splicer value. By now, you should have 4-5 active breach locations creating a galaxy-spanning network. Your hero allows you to store produced ships and deploy them directly into combat, enabling devastating alpha strikes. The Sorrow becomes a forward production base that threatens the entire board.

## III. The Basics

### A. Home System & Commodities

**Home System:** Ahk Creuxx
- 4 resources / 2 influence
- **Total: 4 optimal resources / 0 optimal influence + 2 optimal influence**

**Special:** The Sorrow (tile 94) is placed where your home system would normally go. The Sorrow is NOT a home system but starts with an inactive breach. Your actual home system (tile 118 - Ahk Creuxx) goes in your play area and can be placed during setup using Sea of Tears.

**Commodities:** 4

Your home system provides strong resources (4), making you economically solid from the start. The Sorrow creates a unique dual-location setup that gives you incredible flexibility in board positioning.

### B. Starting Fleet
- 1 Dreadnought
- 1 Carrier (capacity 6)
- 1 Destroyer
- 2 Fighters
- 4 Infantry
- 1 Space Dock
- 2 PDS

This is one of the strongest starting fleets in the game. The dreadnought provides early combat power, the 2 PDS give you defensive coverage, and the destroyer has your unique Exile abilities. You're prepared for aggression or defense from round 1.

### C. Starting Tech

**Choose one blue or red technology with no prerequisites**

This is a flexible start. Recommended options:
- **Gravity Drive** (Blue): Exceptional for mobility, though your breaches provide similar value
- **Plasma Scoring** (Red): Boosts your starting dreadnought's combat effectiveness
- **Antimass Deflectors** (Blue): Mobility through asteroid fields/supernovas
- **Magen Defense Grid** (Red): Defensive option if you expect early aggression

Most players choose Gravity Drive for the mobility stack with breaches, or Plasma Scoring for early combat power.

### D. Faction Abilities

**Sundered:** You cannot use wormholes other than epsilon wormholes. Other players' units that move or are placed into your home system are destroyed.

This is a double-edged sword. You can't use the wormhole network that connects the galaxy, but your home system becomes a fortress that instantly kills enemy units. This makes you nearly impossible to attack at home.

**Incursion:** When you activate a system that contains a breach, you may flip that breach. Systems that contain active breaches are adjacent to each other. At the end of the status phase, any player with ships in a system that contains an active breach may remove that breach.

This is your core identity. Active breaches make systems adjacent to EACH OTHER (not just to one system). If you have active breaches in systems A, B, and C, all three systems are adjacent to each other. This creates a web of movement options.

**Sea of Tears:** When you create the game board, place the Sorrow (tile 94) where your home system would be placed, and place an inactive breach in it. The Sorrow is not a home system. Then, place your home system (tile 118) in your play area.

This gives you a unique setup where you have two locations: The Sorrow (which acts as your board position) and Ahk Creuxx (your actual home system in your play area). The Sorrow starts with an inactive breach.

### E. Leaders

**Agent - Ahk Ravin:** Exhaust this agent to choose 1 player. That player may swap the position of 2 of their ships in any systems; they may transport units when they swap.

This provides repositioning for you or allies. Swapping ship positions can save units from combat, reposition for objectives, or enable unexpected moves. The ability to transport during the swap makes it very powerful.

**Commander - Ahk Siever:**
- **Unlock:** Place a breach token in a system that contains another player's unit
- **Ability:** At the end of a combat between any players, gain 1 commodity or convert 1 of your commodities to a trade good

Your commander converts combat into economy. Every combat in the game generates value for you. This incentivizes aggression and makes you money while fighting.

**Hero - Homesick Phantom:**
- **Unlock:** Have 3 scored objectives
- **Fragment Reality:** When you produce ships, you may place any of those ships onto this card. At the start of a space combat, you may purge this card to place all ships from this card into the active system.

This is an incredible combat ability. You can store produced ships over multiple rounds and then deploy them all at once directly into a combat. This enables devastating ambushes.

### F. Promissory Note

**Sever:** Place this card faceup in your play area and place the sever token in a system that contains your units; wormholes in that system have no effect during movement. Remove the sever token and return this card to the Rebellion player at the end of the status phase.

This is anti-wormhole tech. It shuts down wormhole movement in a system, which can block Creuss, cut off wormhole routes, or deny wormhole-based objectives. It's situationally powerful.

### G. Alliance

When you place a breach token, your ally may place a breach token in an adjacent system that contains one of their ships. This system is also adjacent to systems with active breaches you control.

This extends your breach network to your ally, giving them access to your web of adjacencies. This is powerful for mobile factions or those needing positional flexibility.

### H. Mech

**Revenant:** Cost 2, Combat 6, Sustain Damage
- **DEPLOY:** During the "Commit Ground Forces" step of your tactical action in a system that contains an active breach, you may commit 1 mech, even if you have no units in the system.

Your mechs can deploy from anywhere to any system with an active breach. This makes them incredibly flexible ground combat tools and objective enablers.

### I. Flagship

**Quietus:** Cost 8, Combat 5 (x2), Move 1, Capacity 3, Sustain Damage

While this unit is in a system that contains an active breach, other players' units in systems with active breaches lose all their unit abilities.

This is a devastating debuff flagship. When parked in a breach system, it strips abilities from all enemy units in ALL breach systems. This shuts down Sustain Damage, PRODUCTION, special abilities, everything. It's one of the strongest flagships in the game when your breach network is established.

### J. Breakthrough

**Resonance Generator:** B<>R (Blue-Red synergy)

During your tactical actions, apply +1 to the move value of each of your ships that starts its movement in your home system or in a system that contains an active breach.

**ACTION:** Exhaust this card to flip any breach or place an active breach in a non-home system that contains your units.

This breakthrough is essential to your strategy. The +1 movement from home/breaches stacks with Gravity Drive for 3 movement, and the action ability lets you create/flip breaches without activating systems. This is incredibly powerful for network management.

### K. Slice Considerations

**Must Have:**
- Access to Mecatol Rex or The Fracture (breach networks enable distant objectives)
- At least 4-5 systems in your slice to place breaches
- 1-2 high-resource planets (you need production capacity)

**Nice to Have:**
- Blue or red tech skips (supports breakthrough and unit upgrades)
- Planets with anomalies (your breaches ignore traditional movement restrictions)
- Cultural planets (for stage II objectives)

**Avoid:**
- Slices dependent on wormhole travel (you can't use wormholes)
- Ultra-low influence slices (you need some influence for politics)
- Slices with only 2-3 systems (you need space for breach network)

**Speaker Priority:** Low-Medium (4-6th pick)

You're not desperate for early strategy cards, but you benefit from controlling when you activate Technology or Construction. Mid-pack speaker position is ideal.

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

**Wormhole Exclusion:** Sundered means you cannot use alpha, beta, or gamma wormholes. On maps where wormholes connect key systems, you're at a significant disadvantage until your breach network compensates.

**Breach Vulnerability:** Your entire strategy relies on breach tokens remaining active. Any player with ships in a breach system can remove it at the end of status phase, potentially collapsing your network. You need to constantly maintain and refresh breaches.

**Home System Isolation:** Your actual home system (Ahk Creuxx) sits in your play area, not on the board. This means you can't easily produce ships there unless you bring your space dock to it (which is unusual). The Sorrow becomes your primary production base.

**Commander Unlock Timing:** Your commander unlocks when you place a breach in a system with another player's unit. This requires aggression or forward positioning, which might not align with early-game objectives.

**Faction Tech Investment:** Subatomic Splicer requires yellow prerequisites, which isn't your natural color. Exile II requires 2 red prerequisites. This creates tech path pressure.

**Low Influence:** Your home system provides only 2 influence, making you influence-poor in the early game. Politics and agenda phase can be challenging.

## V. Technology

### A. Starting Technologies

**Choose one blue or red technology with no prerequisites:**
- **Gravity Drive (recommended):** Stacks with Resonance Generator for 3 movement from breaches
- **Plasma Scoring:** Makes your starting dreadnought more lethal
- **Antimass Deflectors:** Mobility through anomalies
- **Magen Defense Grid:** Defensive planetary option

### B. Technology Paths

**Primary Path - Breach Optimization:**
1. Gravity Drive (if not starting tech) - Essential for mobility
2. Exile II (Red-Red) - Upgraded destroyers with breach placement ability
3. Fleet Logistics - Double activation enables breach network exploitation
4. Subatomic Splicer (Yellow) - Rebuild destroyed ships at home

This path maximizes your breach network utility and combat resilience.

**Alternative Path - Combat Focus:**
1. Plasma Scoring (if not starting tech)
2. Dreadnought II
3. Gravity Drive
4. Duranium Armor
5. Assault Cannon

This builds a powerful combat fleet that leverages your breach mobility for strikes.

**Economic Path:**
1. Sarween Tools
2. Gravity Drive
3. Predictive Intelligence
4. Fleet Logistics

Focus on economy and card advantage, using breaches for positional scoring rather than combat.

### C. Key Technologies

**Must Get:**
- **Gravity Drive:** Stacks with Resonance Generator for 3-movement from breaches
- **Exile II:** Your faction tech that places breaches after ANY player's combat in range

**High Priority:**
- **Fleet Logistics:** Double activations with breach network is incredibly powerful
- **Subatomic Splicer:** Faction tech that rebuilds destroyed ships at home space dock

**Solid Options:**
- **Dreadnought II:** Your starting dread benefits greatly from the upgrade
- **Carrier II:** Increased capacity helps with infantry transport through breach network
- **Light-Wave Deflector:** Expensive but powerful defensive tech

## VI. Strategy Cards

### A. Round 1 Ratings

**Leadership (1):** **Good**. 3 command tokens enable aggressive breach placement and expansion. The secondary helps you build initial fleet.

**Diplomacy (2):** **Bad**. You want to activate systems to place breaches, not lock them down. Anti-synergistic.

**Politics (3):** **Good**. Speaker priority and action cards are valuable. Influence refresh helps with your low-influence start.

**Construction (4):** **Great**. You can place a second space dock in The Sorrow or another breach system, creating multiple production nodes in your network.

**Trade (5):** **Great**. 4 commodities means Trade gives you excellent economic value. You need resources for ship production.

**Warfare (6):** **Good**. Fleet token return is useful when you're activating multiple breach systems. Secondary helps allies.

**Technology (7):** **Like**. You start with 1 tech but need to build toward Gravity Drive (if not starting) and Exile II. Technology accelerates this.

**Imperial (8):** **Good**. Points are always valuable, and you can often hold Mecatol through breach teleportation.

### B. General Strategy Card Priority

**Early Game (Rounds 1-2):**
Trade > Construction > Leadership > Technology

**Mid Game (Rounds 3-4):**
Imperial > Leadership > Trade > Warfare

**Late Game (Rounds 5+):**
Imperial > Leadership > Warfare > Politics

## VII. Intermediate

### A. Unit Composition

**Early Game (Rounds 1-3):**
- Core: 1-2 Dreadnoughts, 2-3 Carriers, 2-3 Destroyers
- Screen: 6-8 Fighters
- Ground: 8-10 Infantry, 0-1 Mechs
- Support: 1-2 Space Docks, 2-3 PDS (including starting)

**Mid Game (Rounds 3-5):**
- Core: 2-3 Dreadnoughts, 3-4 Carriers, 3-4 Destroyers
- Screen: 10-12 Fighters
- Ground: 12-15 Infantry, 1-2 Mechs
- Support: 2 Space Docks, 2-4 PDS
- Special: Flagship if available

**Late Game (Rounds 5+):**
- Core: 3 Dreadnoughts, 4-5 Carriers, 4-5 Destroyers
- Screen: 12-16 Fighters
- Ground: 15+ Infantry, 2-3 Mechs
- Support: 2-3 Space Docks, 4-6 PDS
- Special: Flagship deployed in key breach system

**Notes:**
- Destroyers are your special unit (Exile I/II) - prioritize them
- Your breach network means you need mobile carriers, not stationary defense
- PDS can cover breach systems, creating defensive nodes
- Mechs deploy from anywhere to breach systems - build them when needed

### B. Point Planning

**Christmas Land Scoring (10-point game):**

| Round | Public | Secret | MR | Bonus | Total | Cumulative |
|-------|--------|--------|-----|-------|-------|------------|
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 3 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 4 |
| 5 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 6 |
| 6 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 8 |
| 7 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 10 |

**Notes:**
- Round 2: Score resource or planet control objective
- Round 3: Commander unlocks, enabling combat secret or ship secret
- Round 5: Take Mecatol through breach network
- Round 6: Score second secret (likely combat or tech-related)
- Round 7: Imperial on Mecatol for final point

### C. Game Plan

**Breach Network Strategy:**

Your primary game plan revolves around establishing and maintaining a breach network that connects key systems across the galaxy.

**Round 1-2:** Place your first breaches in systems that:
1. Connect your home area to valuable planets
2. Create lanes toward Mecatol Rex or The Fracture
3. Provide defensive coverage for your slice

**Round 3-4:** Activate Resonance Generator and use its action ability to flip breaches or place new ones without activating systems. Build toward 4-5 active breaches creating a web of adjacencies.

**Round 5+:** Leverage your breach network to:
- Move entire fleet across the galaxy in one activation
- Threaten multiple opponents simultaneously
- Score objectives requiring distant system control
- Deploy mechs to any breach system for ground combat

**The Sorrow as Forward Base:**

The Sorrow starts with a breach and isn't your home system, making it a perfect forward production base. Place a space dock there and use it to produce ships that can immediately move through your breach network.

**Subatomic Splicer Value:**

Once you have Subatomic Splicer, you can afford to be more aggressive. Losing ships in combat isn't permanent - you rebuild them at your home system space dock. This makes you exceptionally resilient in prolonged conflicts.

**Commander Economy Engine:**

After unlocking Ahk Siever, you generate commodities/trade goods from ANY combat between any players. This means:
1. You benefit from table-wide conflict
2. Every combat you initiate generates income
3. You can afford to fight more because combat pays for itself

## IX. Alliance Priority

**Best Alliance Partners:**

1. **Nomad (The Company of Shan):** Their mobility complements your breach network; they can exploit your breaches while providing combat support

2. **Ghosts of Creuss:** Despite your wormhole restriction, alliance with Creuss gives them breach access while they provide wormhole value to themselves

3. **Barony of Letnev:** Strong combat faction that benefits from breach mobility; they can strike through your network

4. **Arborec:** Slow faction that desperately needs mobility; your breaches solve their movement problem

5. **L1Z1X:** Combat faction that uses breach network for invasions; strong aggressive partnership

**Worst Alliance Partners:**

1. **Xxcha:** Defensive faction doesn't benefit from your aggressive breach network

2. **Winnu:** Their Mecatol focus doesn't synergize with your multi-front breach strategy

3. **Yssaril:** They prefer political play over the combat focus your breaches enable

## X. End Notes

Crimson Rebellion is one of the most unique and complex factions in Twilight Imperium. Your breach mechanic fundamentally changes how you interact with the game board, transforming distance from a limitation into an irrelevance. While everyone else measures moves and calculates range, you're creating a network of instant connections that let you be everywhere at once.

The key to mastering Crimson is breach network management. You need to constantly evaluate which systems should have breaches, when to flip them active, and how to prevent opponents from removing them. Each breach is both a tool and a vulnerability - it enables your strategy but can be destroyed by any player with ships in that system.

Your biggest challenge is the early game. Before your breach network is established, you're a strong but unremarkable faction with a wormhole restriction that might hurt you. You need to survive rounds 1-2 while setting up your infrastructure, then explode into action once your network is operational.

When you nail Crimson, you create moments of absolute shock at the table. Opponents think they're safe 6 systems away, only to watch you teleport an entire fleet through your breach network and strike in a single activation. Your Sundered home system becomes legendary as opponents lose ships trying to attack you. Your Quietus flagship strips abilities from units across multiple systems simultaneously.

Crimson Rebellion isn't just a faction - it's a paradigm shift in how Twilight Imperium maps work. Master the breach network, and you'll bend space and time to your will.
