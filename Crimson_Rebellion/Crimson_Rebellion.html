<p><em>Art credit: Fantasy Flight Games (Thunder’s Edge)</em></p>
<h2 id="i.-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>The Crimson Rebellion is TI4’s breach specialists, masters of
creating temporary wormhole-like connections across the galaxy. While
other factions rely on traditional movement, you bend space itself
through breach tokens, creating unexpected adjacencies that allow you to
strike anywhere, anytime. You’re the faction that turns the map into a
spiderweb of potential connections, threatening multiple fronts
simultaneously while remaining frustratingly hard to pin down.</p>
<p>Your defining trait is the breach mechanic combined with the Sundered
ability. You can’t use normal wormholes (they’re how you were exiled in
the first place), but you create your own network through breach tokens.
These breaches make systems adjacent to each other, allowing you to move
vast distances in a single activation. Combined with your home system’s
defensive ability that destroys enemy units that enter it, you’re a
faction built around controlling space and time.</p>
<p>The Crimson Rebellion excels at surgical strikes, economic
harassment, and objective flexibility. Your Subatomic Splicer technology
lets you rebuild destroyed ships at your home system, making you
incredibly resilient. Your commander generates income from combat,
turning aggression into economy. You’re not the strongest militarily,
but you’re the most unpredictable and adaptive.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-playstyle">II. Playstyle</h2>
<p>The Crimson philosophy is strategic positioning through breach
network creation. You want to identify key systems across the board and
link them with breaches, creating a web of adjacencies that only you can
exploit effectively. This gives you threat projection far beyond what
your fleet size suggests.</p>
<p>Early game Crimson focuses on exploration and initial breach
placement. Your starting dreadnought and destroyer provide solid combat
capability, and your 2 PDS give you defensive options. You want to
establish 2-3 breach locations by round 2, creating lanes for economic
expansion and objective scoring.</p>
<p>Mid-game transitions into aggressive breach exploitation. With your
Resonance Generator breakthrough active, you gain +1 movement from your
home system and breach locations, allowing you to cover massive
distances. Your commander should unlock around round 3-4, converting
your combat actions into economic gains. This is when you leverage your
unpredictability to score objectives while opponents struggle to defend
multiple vectors.</p>
<p>Late game Crimson is about breach network dominance and Subatomic
Splicer value. By now, you should have 4-5 active breach locations
creating a galaxy-spanning network. Your hero allows you to store
produced ships and deploy them directly into combat, enabling
devastating alpha strikes. The Sorrow becomes a forward production base
that threatens the entire board.</p>
<h2 id="iii.-the-basics">III. The Basics</h2>
<h3 id="a.-home-system-commodities">A. Home System &amp;
Commodities</h3>
<p><strong>Home System:</strong> - <strong>Ahk Creuxx:</strong> 4
resources / 2 influence - <strong>Total: 4 resources / 2 influence (4
optimal resources / 2 optimal influence)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Special:</strong> The Sorrow (tile 94) is placed where your
home system would normally go. The Sorrow is NOT a home system but
starts with an inactive breach. Your actual home system (tile 118 - Ahk
Creuxx) goes in your play area and can be placed during setup using Sea
of Tears.</p>
<p><strong>Commodities:</strong> 4</p>
<p>Your home system provides strong resources (4), making you
economically solid from the start. The Sorrow creates a unique
dual-location setup that gives you incredible flexibility in board
positioning.</p>
<h3 id="b.-starting-fleet">B. Starting Fleet</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 Dreadnought</li>
<li>1 Carrier (capacity 6)</li>
<li>1 Destroyer</li>
<li>2 Fighters</li>
<li>4 Infantry</li>
<li>1 Space Dock</li>
<li>2 PDS</li>
</ul>
<p>This is one of the strongest starting fleets in the game. The
dreadnought provides early combat power, the 2 PDS give you defensive
coverage, and the destroyer has your unique Exile abilities. You’re
prepared for aggression or defense from round 1.</p>
<h3 id="c.-faction-abilities">C. Faction Abilities</h3>
<p><strong>Sundered:</strong> You cannot use wormholes other than
epsilon wormholes. Other players’ units that move or are placed into
your home system are destroyed.</p>
<p>This is a double-edged sword. You can’t use the wormhole network that
connects the galaxy, but your home system becomes a fortress that
instantly kills enemy units. This makes you nearly impossible to attack
at home.</p>
<p><strong>Incursion:</strong> When you activate a system that contains
a breach, you may flip that breach. Systems that contain active breaches
are adjacent to each other. At the end of the status phase, any player
with ships in a system that contains an active breach may remove that
breach.</p>
<p>This is your core identity. Active breaches make systems adjacent to
EACH OTHER (not just to one system). If you have active breaches in
systems A, B, and C, all three systems are adjacent to each other. This
creates a web of movement options.</p>
<p><strong>Sea of Tears:</strong> When you create the game board, place
the Sorrow (tile 94) where your home system would be placed, and place
an inactive breach in it. The Sorrow is not a home system. Then, place
your home system (tile 118) in your play area.</p>
<p>This gives you a unique setup where you have two locations: The
Sorrow (which acts as your board position) and Ahk Creuxx (your actual
home system in your play area). The Sorrow starts with an inactive
breach.</p>
<h3 id="d.-starting-and-faction-technologies">D. Starting and Faction
Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Technologies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Choose one blue or red technology with no
prerequisites</strong></p>
<p>This is a flexible start. Recommended options: - <strong>Gravity
Drive</strong>: Exceptional for mobility, though your breaches provide
similar value - <strong>Plasma Scoring</strong>: Boosts your starting
dreadnought’s combat effectiveness - <strong>Antimass
Deflectors</strong>: Mobility through asteroid fields/supernovas -
<strong>Magen Defense Grid</strong>: Defensive option if you expect
early aggression</p>
<p>Most players choose Gravity Drive for the mobility stack with
breaches, or Plasma Scoring for early combat power.</p>
<p><strong>Faction Technologies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Exile II (RR):</strong> <em>Crimson Rebellion Destroyer -
Cost: 1 | Combat: 7 | Move: 2 | ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE 6 (x3)</em></p>
<p>At the end of any player’s combat in this unit’s system or up to 2
systems away, you may place 1 active or inactive breach in that
system.</p>
<p><strong>Subatomic Splicer (Y):</strong> <em>When one of your ships is
destroyed, you may produce a ship of the same type at a space dock in
your home system.</em></p>
<h3 id="e.-leaders">E. Leaders</h3>
<p><strong>Agent - Ahk Ravin:</strong> ACTION: Exhaust this card to
choose 1 player. That player may swap the position of 2 of their ships
in any systems; they may transport units when they swap.</p>
<p>This provides repositioning for you or allies. Swapping ship
positions can save units from combat, reposition for objectives, or
enable unexpected moves. The ability to transport during the swap makes
it very powerful.</p>
<p><strong>Commander - Ahk Siever:</strong> - <strong>Unlock:</strong>
Place a breach token in a system that contains another player’s unit -
<strong>Ability:</strong> At the end of a combat between any players,
gain 1 commodity or convert 1 of your commodities to a trade good</p>
<p>Your commander converts combat into economy. Every combat in the game
generates value for you. This incentivizes aggression and makes you
money while fighting.</p>
<p><strong>Hero - Homesick Phantom:</strong> - <strong>Unlock:</strong>
Have 3 scored objectives - <strong>Fragment Reality:</strong> When you
produce ships, you may place any of those ships onto this card. At the
start of a space combat, you may purge this card to place all ships from
this card into the active system.</p>
<p>This is an incredible combat ability. You can store produced ships
over multiple rounds and then deploy them all at once directly into a
combat. This enables devastating ambushes.</p>
<h3 id="f.-promissory-note">F. Promissory Note</h3>
<p><strong>Sever:</strong> ACTION: Place this card faceup in your play
area and place the sever token in a system that contains your units;
wormholes in that system have no effect during movement. Remove the
sever token and return this card to the Rebellion player at the end of
the status phase.</p>
<p>This is anti-wormhole tech. It shuts down wormhole movement in a
system, which can block Creuss, cut off wormhole routes, or deny
wormhole-based objectives. It’s situationally powerful.</p>
<h3 id="g.-alliance">G. Alliance</h3>
<p>Whoever holds your alliance card has your Commander (Ahk Siever -
gain commodity/TG at end of any combat).</p>
<p>Strong alliance for combat-focused factions. Generates passive income
from table-wide combat.</p>
<h3 id="h.-mech">H. Mech</h3>
<p><strong>Revenant:</strong> Cost 2, Combat 6, Sustain Damage -
<strong>DEPLOY:</strong> During the “Commit Ground Forces” step of your
tactical action in a system that contains an active breach, you may
commit 1 mech, even if you have no units in the system.</p>
<p>Your mechs can deploy from anywhere to any system with an active
breach. This makes them incredibly flexible ground combat tools and
objective enablers.</p>
<h3 id="i.-flagship">I. Flagship</h3>
<p><strong>Quietus:</strong> Cost 8, Combat 5 (x2), Move 1, Capacity 3,
Sustain Damage</p>
<p>While this unit is in a system that contains an active breach, other
players units in systems with active breaches lose all their unit
abilities.</p>
<p>This is a devastating debuff flagship. When parked in a breach
system, it strips abilities from all enemy units in ALL breach systems.
This shuts down Sustain Damage, PRODUCTION, special abilities,
everything. It’s one of the strongest flagships in the game when your
breach network is established.</p>
<h3 id="j.-breakthrough">J. Breakthrough</h3>
<p><strong>Resonance Generator:</strong> B&lt;&gt;R (Blue-Red
synergy)</p>
<p>During your tactical actions, apply +1 to the move value of each of
your ships that starts its movement in your home system or in a system
that contains an active breach.</p>
<p><strong>ACTION:</strong> Exhaust this card to flip any breach or
place an active breach in a non-home system that contains your
units.</p>
<p>This breakthrough is essential to your strategy. The +1 movement from
home/breaches stacks with Gravity Drive for 3 movement, and the action
ability lets you create/flip breaches without activating systems. This
is incredibly powerful for network management.</p>
<h3 id="k.-slice-considerations">K. Slice Considerations</h3>
<p><strong>Must Have:</strong> - Access to Mecatol Rex or The Fracture
(breach networks enable distant objectives) - At least 4-5 systems in
your slice to place breaches - 1-2 high-resource planets (you need
production capacity)</p>
<p><strong>Nice to Have:</strong> - Blue or red tech skips (supports
breakthrough and unit upgrades) - Planets with anomalies (your breaches
ignore traditional movement restrictions) - Cultural planets (for stage
II objectives)</p>
<p><strong>Avoid:</strong> - Slices dependent on wormhole travel (you
can’t use wormholes) - Ultra-low influence slices (you need some
influence for politics) - Slices with only 2-3 systems (you need space
for breach network)</p>
<p><strong>Speaker Priority:</strong> Low-Medium (4-6th pick)</p>
<p>You’re not desperate for early strategy cards, but you benefit from
controlling when you activate Technology or Construction. Mid-pack
speaker position is ideal.</p>
<h2 id="iv.-structural-weaknesses">IV. Structural Weaknesses</h2>
<h3 id="a.-first-turn-priorities">A. First Turn Priorities</h3>
<p>As Crimson Rebellion, your first turn priorities should reflect your
breach network establishment and mobility-focused strategy. Here’s the
recommended ordering:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Expansion + Production</strong> - Despite your breach
mobility, you need planets and resources first. Your 4-resource home and
4 commodities provide a decent start, but you must expand to 2-3
additional planets Round 1 to support your fleet production. Use your
strong starting fleet (dreadnought + destroyer + carrier) for aggressive
expansion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Breakthrough</strong> - Establishing your breach network
takes priority over raw expansion. Place your first 1-2 breach tokens in
systems that connect your home area to high-value targets. Resonance
Generator (your breakthrough) is critical mid-game but requires the
network foundation first.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology</strong> - Gravity Drive (if not starting
tech) or pushing toward Exile II unlocks your mobility potential.
However, breach placement and territorial control come first—tech
accelerates an existing network, it doesn’t create one.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scoring</strong> - Your ability to score early is limited
until your breach network connects 3-4 systems. Focus Rounds 1-2 on
network establishment; scoring acceleration comes Round 3+ when breaches
enable objective flexibility.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Wormhole Exclusion:</strong> Sundered means you cannot use
alpha, beta, or gamma wormholes. On maps where wormholes connect key
systems, you’re at a significant disadvantage until your breach network
compensates.</p>
<p><strong>Breach Vulnerability:</strong> Your entire strategy relies on
breach tokens remaining active. Any player with ships in a breach system
can remove it at the end of status phase, potentially collapsing your
network. You need to constantly maintain and refresh breaches.</p>
<p><strong>Home System Isolation:</strong> Your actual home system (Ahk
Creuxx) sits in your play area, not on the board. This means you can’t
easily produce ships there unless you bring your space dock to it (which
is unusual). The Sorrow becomes your primary production base.</p>
<p><strong>Commander Unlock Timing:</strong> Your commander unlocks when
you place a breach in a system with another player’s unit. This requires
aggression or forward positioning, which might not align with early-game
objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Faction Tech Investment:</strong> Subatomic Splicer requires
yellow prerequisites, which isn’t your natural color. Exile II requires
2 red prerequisites. This creates tech path pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Low Influence:</strong> Your home system provides only 2
influence, making you influence-poor in the early game. Politics and
agenda phase can be challenging.</p>
<h2 id="v.-technology">V. Technology</h2>
<h3 id="a.-overview">A. Overview</h3>
<p>You start by choosing one blue or red technology with no
prerequisites. Focus on breach synergies and unit upgrades via Riftmeld
if needed.</p>
<h3 id="b.-starting-technologies">B. Starting Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Choose one blue or red technology with no
prerequisites:</strong> - <strong>Gravity Drive (recommended):</strong>
Stacks with Resonance Generator for 3 movement from breaches -
<strong>Plasma Scoring:</strong> Makes your starting dreadnought more
lethal - <strong>Antimass Deflectors:</strong> Mobility through
anomalies - <strong>Magen Defense Grid:</strong> Defensive planetary
option</p>
<h3 id="c.-technology-paths">C. Technology Paths</h3>
<p><strong>Primary Path - Breach Optimization:</strong> 1. Gravity Drive
(if not starting tech) - Essential for mobility 2. Exile II (Red-Red) -
Upgraded destroyers with breach placement ability 3. Fleet Logistics -
Double activation enables breach network exploitation 4. Subatomic
Splicer (Yellow) - Rebuild destroyed ships at home</p>
<p>This path maximizes your breach network utility and combat
resilience.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative Path - Combat Focus:</strong> 1. Plasma Scoring
(if not starting tech) 2. Dreadnought II 3. Gravity Drive 4. Duranium
Armor 5. Assault Cannon</p>
<p>This builds a powerful combat fleet that leverages your breach
mobility for strikes.</p>
<p><strong>Economic Path:</strong> 1. Sarween Tools 2. Gravity Drive 3.
Predictive Intelligence 4. Fleet Logistics</p>
<p>Focus on economy and card advantage, using breaches for positional
scoring rather than combat.</p>
<h3 id="d.-key-technologies">D. Key Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Must Get:</strong> - <strong>Gravity Drive:</strong> Stacks
with Resonance Generator for 3-movement from breaches - <strong>Exile
II:</strong> Your faction tech that places breaches after ANY player’s
combat in range</p>
<p><strong>High Priority:</strong> - <strong>Fleet Logistics:</strong>
Double activations with breach network is incredibly powerful -
<strong>Subatomic Splicer:</strong> Faction tech that rebuilds destroyed
ships at home space dock</p>
<p><strong>Solid Options:</strong> - <strong>Dreadnought II:</strong>
Your starting dread benefits greatly from the upgrade - <strong>Carrier
II:</strong> Increased capacity helps with infantry transport through
breach network - <strong>Light-Wave Deflector:</strong> Expensive but
powerful defensive tech</p>
<h2 id="vi.-strategy-cards">VI. Strategy Cards</h2>
<h3 id="a.-round-1">A. Round 1</h3>
<p>Your R1 priority is establishing breach network foundation and
economic base for fleet production.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1 Priority Ranking:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Trade</strong> - You have 4 commodities. Excellent
economic value for ship production and breach network
expansion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Construction</strong> - Place second space dock in The
Sorrow or breach system. Multiple production nodes support breach
strategy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leadership</strong> - Command tokens enable breach
placement and aggressive expansion. Secondary builds initial
fleet.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology</strong> - Begin tech path toward Exile II
(destroyer upgrade with breach placement) and Gravity Drive for
mobility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Politics</strong> - Speaker priority and action cards
valuable. Influence refresh helps with low-influence start (2).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Warfare</strong> - Fleet token return useful for multiple
breach system activations. Secondary helps allies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Anti-synergistic. You want to
activate systems to place breaches, not lock them down.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Imperial</strong> - Never R1.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="b.-round-2">B. Round 2+</h3>
<p><strong>Love:</strong> - <strong>Trade</strong> - Refresh 4
commodities for consistent economy. Resources fuel breach network
expansion and ship production. - <strong>Leadership</strong> - Command
tokens critical for activating breach systems and placing new breaches.
Constant CC needs. - <strong>Imperial</strong> - Score objectives.
Breach network enables Mecatol teleportation for point holding.</p>
<p><strong>Good:</strong> - <strong>Construction</strong> - Additional
space docks in breach systems create distributed production nodes across
your network. - <strong>Technology</strong> - Stay on path toward Exile
II (breach placement destroyer) and Gravity Drive (mobility stacks with
breaches). - <strong>Warfare</strong> - Fleet token return when
activating multiple breach systems. Redistribution after breach
movements.</p>
<p><strong>Situational:</strong> - <strong>Politics</strong> - Only if
you need speaker or agenda control. Your 2 home influence makes voting
challenging without TG spending.</p>
<h2 id="vii.-intermediate">VII. Intermediate</h2>
<h3 id="a.-unit-composition">A. Unit Composition</h3>
<p><strong>Early Game (Rounds 1-3):</strong> - Core: 1-2 Dreadnoughts,
2-3 Carriers, 2-3 Destroyers - Screen: 6-8 Fighters - Ground: 8-10
Infantry, 0-1 Mechs - Support: 1-2 Space Docks, 2-3 PDS (including
starting)</p>
<p><strong>Mid Game (Rounds 3-5):</strong> - Core: 2-3 Dreadnoughts, 3-4
Carriers, 3-4 Destroyers - Screen: 10-12 Fighters - Ground: 12-15
Infantry, 1-2 Mechs - Support: 2 Space Docks, 2-4 PDS - Special:
Flagship if available</p>
<p><strong>Late Game (Rounds 5+):</strong> - Core: 3 Dreadnoughts, 4-5
Carriers, 4-5 Destroyers - Screen: 12-16 Fighters - Ground: 15+
Infantry, 2-3 Mechs - Support: 2-3 Space Docks, 4-6 PDS - Special:
Flagship deployed in key breach system</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> - Destroyers are your special unit (Exile
I/II) - prioritize them - Your breach network means you need mobile
carriers, not stationary defense - PDS can cover breach systems,
creating defensive nodes - Mechs deploy from anywhere to breach systems
- build them when needed</p>
<h3 id="b.-game-plan">B. Game Plan</h3>
<p><strong>Breach Network Strategy:</strong></p>
<p>Your primary game plan revolves around establishing and maintaining a
breach network that connects key systems across the galaxy.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1-2:</strong> Place your first breaches in systems
that: 1. Connect your home area to valuable planets 2. Create lanes
toward Mecatol Rex or The Fracture 3. Provide defensive coverage for
your slice</p>
<p><strong>Round 3-4:</strong> Activate Resonance Generator and use its
action ability to flip breaches or place new ones without activating
systems. Build toward 4-5 active breaches creating a web of
adjacencies.</p>
<p><strong>Round 5+:</strong> Leverage your breach network to: - Move
entire fleet across the galaxy in one activation - Threaten multiple
opponents simultaneously - Score objectives requiring distant system
control - Deploy mechs to any breach system for ground combat</p>
<p><strong>The Sorrow as Forward Base:</strong></p>
<p>The Sorrow starts with a breach and isn’t your home system, making it
a perfect forward production base. Place a space dock there and use it
to produce ships that can immediately move through your breach
network.</p>
<p><strong>Subatomic Splicer Value:</strong></p>
<p>Once you have Subatomic Splicer, you can afford to be more
aggressive. Losing ships in combat isn’t permanent - you rebuild them at
your home system space dock. This makes you exceptionally resilient in
prolonged conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>Commander Economy Engine:</strong></p>
<p>After unlocking Ahk Siever, you generate commodities/trade goods from
ANY combat between any players. This means: 1. You benefit from
table-wide conflict 2. Every combat you initiate generates income 3. You
can afford to fight more because combat pays for itself</p>
<h2 id="viii.-objectives">VIII. Objectives</h2>
<h3 id="a.-objective-summary">A. Objective Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Crimson Rebellion excels at movement and
positioning objectives through breach network adjacencies, allowing
instant access to distant systems. Combat objectives are achievable with
Ahk Siever commander generating income, and tech objectives benefit from
flexible paths.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Planet control objectives are
challenging without natural expansion bonuses, requiring more setup than
territorial factions. Structure objectives are difficult, and influence
spending can be hard with limited home influence.</p>

<p>Crimson Rebellion’s breach network enables unique objective scoring
through map manipulation and mobility.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="ix.-alliance-priority">IX. Alliance Priority</h2>
<p><strong>Best Alliance Partners:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Nomad (The Company of Shan):</strong> Their mobility
complements your breach network; they can exploit your breaches while
providing combat support</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ghosts of Creuss:</strong> Despite your wormhole
restriction, alliance with Creuss gives them breach access while they
provide wormhole value to themselves</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Barony of Letnev:</strong> Strong combat faction that
benefits from breach mobility; they can strike through your
network</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Arborec:</strong> Slow faction that desperately needs
mobility; your breaches solve their movement problem</p></li>
<li><p><strong>L1Z1X:</strong> Combat faction that uses breach network
for invasions; strong aggressive partnership</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Worst Alliance Partners:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Xxcha:</strong> Defensive faction doesn’t benefit from
your aggressive breach network</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Winnu:</strong> Their Mecatol focus doesn’t synergize
with your multi-front breach strategy</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Yssaril:</strong> They prefer political play over the
combat focus your breaches enable</p></li>

<p>Crimson Rebellion is one of the most unique and complex factions in
Twilight Imperium. Your breach mechanic fundamentally changes how you
interact with the game board, transforming distance from a limitation
into an irrelevance. While everyone else measures moves and calculates
range, you’re creating a network of instant connections that let you be
everywhere at once.</p>
<p>The key to mastering Crimson is breach network management. You need
to constantly evaluate which systems should have breaches, when to flip
them active, and how to prevent opponents from removing them. Each
breach is both a tool and a vulnerability - it enables your strategy but
can be destroyed by any player with ships in that system.</p>
<p>Your biggest challenge is the early game. Before your breach network
is established, you’re a strong but unremarkable faction with a wormhole
restriction that might hurt you. You need to survive rounds 1-2 while
setting up your infrastructure, then explode into action once your
network is operational.</p>
<p>When you nail Crimson, you create moments of absolute shock at the
table. Opponents think they’re safe 6 systems away, only to watch you
teleport an entire fleet through your breach network and strike in a
single activation. Your Sundered home system becomes legendary as
opponents lose ships trying to attack you. Your Quietus flagship strips
abilities from units across multiple systems simultaneously.</p>
<p>Crimson Rebellion isn’t just a faction - it’s a paradigm shift in how
Twilight Imperium maps work. Master the breach network, and you’ll bend
space and time to your will.</p>
