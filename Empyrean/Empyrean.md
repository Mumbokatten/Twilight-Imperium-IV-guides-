# Empyrean Guide

*Art credit: Fantasy Flight Games (Prophecy of Kings)*

## I. Introduction

The Empyrean are TI4's nebula specialists and diplomatic leverage masters, a faction that transforms one of the game's most restrictive terrain types into a tactical advantage. While other factions see nebulae as movement penalties and combat restrictions, you see them as your natural habitat. Your home system sits in a nebula that doesn't slow you down, you have two faction promissory notes providing unprecedented diplomatic flexibility, and your abilities let you extend movement benefits to neighbors while collecting promissory notes as tax.

Your defining trait is Voidborn, which makes nebulae not affect your ships' movement. This seemingly simple ability is transformative - you move through nebulae at full speed while opponents crawl through them. Combined with Aetherpassage (allowing others to move through your ships) and Dark Whispers (two promissory notes), you're the faction that controls space through permission rather than force.

The Empyrean excel at diplomatic positioning, movement manipulation, and leveraging nebula terrain. You start with Dark Energy Tap technology, giving you immediate access to green tech paths. Your faction technologies provide movement bonuses to neighbors and extract promissory notes as tolls. Your commander unlocks when you're neighbors with everyone, rewarding strategic expansion. You don't dominate through raw power - you dominate through controlling who can move where and extracting value from every activation near you.

## II. Playstyle

The Empyrean philosophy is spatial control through diplomatic leverage and terrain mastery. You want to position yourself adjacent to key systems and players, then use your movement abilities and promissory notes to become indispensable while extracting concessions.

Early game Empyrean focuses on leveraging your nebula home system advantage and establishing neighbor relationships. Your starting tech (Dark Energy Tap) gives you a head start on green tech paths. You want to expand toward systems where your Voidborn ability provides clear advantage - claiming nebula systems opponents struggle to reach.

Mid-game transitions into diplomatic tax collection and movement facilitation. Your Aetherstream faction tech lets you give +1 movement to neighbors activating systems near anomalies, making you valuable as an ally. Your Voidwatch faction tech forces players moving into your systems to give you promissory notes, creating a toll network. Use your two faction promissory notes (Blood Pact for voting, Dark Pact for trade goods) to broker powerful alliances.

Late game Empyrean is about commander value and breakthrough control. Your commander (unlocks when neighboring all players) lets you return command tokens when players move into your systems, creating incredible action economy. Your Void Tether breakthrough lets you control adjacency itself, breaking the map for opponents while maintaining your own routes. Your hero generates massive exploration value, potentially scoring multiple objectives in one action.

## III. The Basics

### A. Home System & Commodities

**Home System:** The Dark (Nebula)
- 3 resources / 4 influence
- **Total: 3 optimal resources / 4 optimal influence**

**Commodities:** 4

Your home system provides excellent influence (4) and sits in a nebula. The nebula doesn't affect your ships (Voidborn) but slows enemy movement, making your home system defensively strong.

### B. Starting Fleet
- 2 Carriers (capacity 12 total)
- 1 Destroyer
- 2 Fighters
- 4 Infantry
- 1 Space Dock

Two starting carriers gives you excellent transport capacity for early expansion. The destroyer provides anti-fighter barrage protection.

### C. Faction Abilities

**Voidborn:** Nebulae do not affect your ships' movement.

This is your core identity. Nebulae normally reduce movement by 1, making 2-tile nebula systems effectively 4 movement away. You ignore this entirely, treating nebulae like empty space. This makes nebula-heavy maps strongly favor you.

**Aetherpassage:** After a player activates a system, you may allow that player to move their ships through systems that contain your ships.

You can grant opponents permission to move through your units. This breaks normal movement rules (can't move through enemy ships) and creates diplomatic leverage. You decide who gets passage and who doesn't.

**Dark Whispers:** During setup, take the additional Empyrean faction promissory note; you have 2 faction promissory notes.

You start with two different promissory notes instead of one. This doubles your diplomatic leverage and creates multiple alliance paths.

### D. Starting and Faction Technologies

**Starting Technologies:**

**Dark Energy Tap:** After you research a technology that is not a faction technology, you may exhaust this card to draw 1 secret objective.

This is a unique starting tech that generates secret objectives whenever you research tech. It accelerates your secret objective completion and gives you choice in which secrets to pursue.

**Faction Technologies:**

(Add faction technology information here if available from the cheat sheet)

### E. Leaders

**Agent - Acamar:** After a player moves ships into a system that does not contain any planets, you may exhaust this card; that player gains 1 command token.

Your agent generates command tokens for players moving into empty systems. This helps allies with action economy and creates goodwill. You control when to use it for maximum diplomatic value.

**Commander - Xuange:**
- **Unlock:** Be neighbors with all other players
- **Ability:** After another player moves ships into a system that contains 1 of your command tokens, you may return that token to your reinforcements.

Your commander returns command tokens when opponents activate systems with your tokens. This is incredible action economy - you effectively get free activations back whenever opponents move near you. The unlock requires neighboring everyone, incentivizing wide expansion.

**Hero - Conservator Procyon:**
- **Unlock:** Have 3 scored objectives
- **Multiverse Shift:** Place 1 frontier token in each system that does not contain any planets and does not already have a frontier token. Then, explore each frontier token that is in a system that contains 1 or more of your ships. Then, purge this card.

This hero floods the board with frontier tokens and lets you explore all of them where you have ships. This can generate 5-10 frontier card draws in one action, potentially scoring multiple exploration-based objectives or gaining massive resource/fragment advantages.

### F. Promissory Note

**Blood Pact:** Place this card faceup in your play area. When you and the Empyrean player cast votes for the same outcome, cast 4 additional votes for that outcome. If you activate a system that contains 1 or more of the Empyrean player's units, return this card to the Empyrean player.

This promissory note provides +4 votes when voting together. It's powerful for political alignment and makes breaking the pact (activating your systems) costly.

**Dark Pact:** Place this card faceup in your play area. When you give a number of commodities to the Empyrean player equal to your maximum commodity value, you each gain 1 trade good. If you activate a system that contains 1 or more of the Empyrean player's units, return this card to the Empyrean player.

This promissory note generates 1 trade good for both players when the holder trades maximum commodities to you. It creates recurring economic value and incentivizes continued trade relationship.

### G. Alliance

When you move ships into a system that contains your ally's units, you may move through that system as if there were no other player's ships in it. When your ally moves ships into a system that contains your units, they may move through that system as if there were no other player's ships in it.

This extends Aetherpassage to your ally as a permanent ability. You both ignore each other's ships for movement, creating incredible tactical flexibility.

### H. Mech

**Watcher:** Cost 2, Combat 6, Sustain Damage

You may remove this unit from a system that contains or is adjacent to another player's units to cancel an action card played by that player.

Your mechs can sacrifice themselves to cancel action cards. This is a powerful defensive tool - mechs positioned near key systems or adjacent to threats can veto Sabotages, Direct Hits, or other critical action cards.

### I. Flagship

**Dynamo:** Cost 8, Combat 5 (x2), Move 1, Capacity 3, Sustain Damage

After any player's unit in this system or an adjacent system uses Sustain Damage, you may spend 2 influence to repair that unit.

Your flagship repairs units (yours or allies') in adjacent systems by spending influence. With your 4-influence home system, you can afford this. The flagship becomes a mobile repair station that keeps fleets sustained through prolonged combats.

### J. Breakthrough

**Void Tether:** B<>G (Blue-Green synergy)

When you activate a system that contains or is adjacent to a unit or planet you control, you may place or move 1 of your void tether tokens onto a border that system shares with another system. Other players do not treat those systems as adjacent to each other unless you allow it.

This is absurd map control. You can sever adjacencies for opponents, preventing movement between systems while you still treat them as adjacent. This can cut off invasion routes, block retreats, or isolate opponents' fleets.

### K. Slice Considerations

**Must Have:**
- Nebula systems in or near your slice (your Voidborn ability makes these premium for you)
- Access to multiple neighbors (commander requires neighboring everyone)
- Systems with anomalies (supports Aetherstream faction tech)

**Nice to Have:**
- Green tech skips (you start with green tech)
- Blue tech skips (supports Aetherstream and breakthrough)
- High-influence planets (your flagship and abilities spend influence)

**Avoid:**
- Isolated slices far from other players (you need neighbor access for commander)
- Slices with no nebulae (wastes your Voidborn advantage)
- Low-influence slices (you spend influence for flagship repairs and other abilities)

**Speaker Priority:** Medium (3-5th pick)

You're not desperate for early strategy cards but benefit from controlling when you take Technology or Politics. Mid-pack speaker is fine.

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

### A. First Turn Priorities

As Empyrean, your first turn priorities should reflect your diplomatic positioning and nebula mobility advantage. Here's the recommended ordering:

1. **Expansion + Production** - Your Voidborn ability lets you move through nebulae at full speed while opponents crawl. Claim nebula systems Round 1 that others cannot easily reach. Your 4-influence home system and 4 commodities support this expansion.

2. **Breakthrough** - Establishing neighbor relationships is critical since your commander requires neighboring ALL players. Trade your two promissory notes (Blood Pact + Dark Pact) early to build diplomatic capital while expanding toward multiple players' borders.

3. **Technology** - Dark Energy Tap (starting tech) draws secret objectives when you research non-faction tech. However, diplomatic positioning and territorial control come first—secrets require board presence to complete.

4. **Scoring** - Your ability to score early is limited until you've established neighbor relationships and positioned for your commander unlock. Focus Rounds 1-2 on expansion and diplomacy; scoring acceleration comes Round 3+ when you're neighbors with most/all players.

**Commander Unlock Difficulty:** Requiring neighbor status with ALL players is challenging. On large maps or with isolated positions, you may never unlock commander. This makes slice selection critical.

**Influence Dependency:** Your flagship repairs cost influence, and you need influence for politics. Your home system provides 4, but you can become influence-starved quickly.

**Promissory Note Vulnerability:** Giving away two promissory notes creates two potential attack vectors. If both holders turn against you and activate your systems, you lose both notes and face dual aggression.

**Combat Weakness:** You have no inherent combat bonuses or special combat abilities. In straight fights, you're average. Your power is in movement and positioning, not fighting.

**Tech Path Pressure:** Dark Energy Tap draws secret objectives, but you need to research multiple technologies to activate it multiple times. This can force suboptimal tech paths.

**Nebula Map Dependency:** Your Voidborn ability is incredible on nebula-heavy maps and mediocre on maps with few nebulae. Map generation variance significantly affects your power level.

## V. Technology

### A. Starting Technologies

**Dark Energy Tap (Green):** After you research a technology that is not a faction technology, exhaust this card to draw 1 secret objective.

### B. Technology Paths

**Path 1 - Diplomatic Leverage:**
1. Dark Energy Tap (starting)
2. Hyper Metabolism (GG) - Ready planets for influence spending
3. Aetherstream (BBG) - Faction tech providing movement bonuses
4. Voidwatch (GGG) - Faction tech extracting promissory notes
5. Psychoarchaeology - Exploration value

This path maximizes your diplomatic and exploration advantages.

**Path 2 - Balanced Growth:**
1. Dark Energy Tap (starting)
2. Gravity Drive (B) - Movement is always valuable
3. Sarween Tools - Economic efficiency
4. Aetherstream (BBG) - Faction tech
5. Carrier II (BB) or Dreadnought II (BBY)

Balances diplomatic tech with military and economic capability.

**Path 3 - Breakthrough Rush:**
1. Dark Energy Tap (starting)
2. Antimass Deflectors (Blue) - Anomaly movement
3. Aetherstream (Blue-Blue-Green) - Faction tech
4. Void Tether Breakthrough (Blue-Green synergy) - Map control
5. Bio-Stims or other utility tech

Rushes to Void Tether for adjacency control.

### C. Key Technologies

**Must Get:**
- **Aetherstream:** Faction tech that gives +1 movement to neighbors near anomalies
- **Gravity Drive:** Mobility is critical for neighboring all players

**High Priority:**
- **Voidwatch:** Faction tech that extracts promissory notes as toll
- **Void Tether:** Breakthrough controlling adjacency
- **Hyper Metabolism:** Influence readying supports flagship repairs

**Solid Options:**
- **Carrier II:** Transport capacity for wide expansion
- **Sarween Tools:** Economic efficiency
- **Psychoarchaeology:** Exploration synergy with hero

## VI. Strategy Cards

### A. Round 1

Your R1 priority is wide expansion to neighbor all players and establish economic base.

**Round 1 Priority Ranking:**

1. **Trade** - 4 commodities + Dark Pact promissory note makes Trade valuable for economic foundation.

2. **Leadership** - Command tokens are valuable for wide expansion to neighbor all players.

3. **Technology** - Dark Energy Tap rewards tech research with secret objectives.

4. **Politics** - 4 influence from home makes politics viable. Speaker priority helps.

5. **Construction** - Extra space dock or PDS supports wide expansion.

6. **Imperial** - Points are always good; Mecatol control is achievable.

7. **Diplomacy** - You can lock down systems while using Aetherpassage to move through them anyway.

8. **Warfare** - Fleet token return is fine but not essential.

### B. Round 2+

**Love:**
- **Imperial** - Score objectives. Your mobility via Aetherpassage enables Mecatol control.
- **Leadership** - Command tokens for continued expansion and Aetherpassage activations.
- **Trade** - Refresh 4 commodities for consistent economy. Dark Pact provides additional value.

**Like:**
- **Technology** - Dark Energy Tap and tech path progression. Secret objectives reward tech diversity.
- **Politics** - 4 home influence makes voting viable. Speaker priority for next round.

**Situational:**
- **Construction** - Only if you need additional space docks or PDS for expansion.
- **Warfare** - Fleet token return useful for specific aggressive plays or repositioning.
- **Diplomacy** - Lock down systems while bypassing them with Aetherpassage. Niche utility.

## VII. Intermediate

### A. Unit Composition

**Early Game (Rounds 1-3):**
- Core: 2-3 Carriers (including starting 2), 1-2 Destroyers, 0-1 Cruisers
- Screen: 4-6 Fighters
- Ground: 8-10 Infantry, 0-1 Mechs
- Support: 1-2 Space Docks, 1 PDS

**Mid Game (Rounds 3-5):**
- Core: 3-4 Carriers, 2-3 Destroyers, 1-2 Cruisers
- Screen: 8-10 Fighters
- Ground: 12-15 Infantry, 1-2 Mechs
- Support: 2 Space Docks, 2-3 PDS
- Special: Flagship if affordable

**Late Game (Rounds 5+):**
- Core: 4-5 Carriers, 2-3 Destroyers, 2-3 Cruisers/Dreadnoughts
- Screen: 10-14 Fighters
- Ground: 15-20 Infantry, 2-3 Mechs
- Support: 2-3 Space Docks, 3-4 PDS
- Special: Flagship active

**Notes:**
- Mechs positioned strategically can cancel critical action cards
- Your carriers need to be spread across the map to neighbor all players
- Don't over-invest in combat; you win through positioning and diplomacy
- Keep infantry reserves for exploration with hero

### C. Game Plan

**Neighbor Network Establishment:**

Your primary game plan revolves around expanding to neighbor all players, unlocking your commander.

**Round 1-2:** Identify the furthest opponents and plan expansion paths toward them. Use your two carriers to claim 2-3 systems in different directions. Trade your two promissory notes to establish alliances that grant you safe passage toward distant neighbors.

**Round 3-4:** Continue expansion toward remaining players you don't neighbor. Use Aetherpassage to help allies move through your space, creating goodwill. Research Aetherstream if possible to provide +1 movement near anomalies.

**Round 5+:** Commander should unlock (neighboring all players). Now whenever opponents activate systems with your tokens, you get those tokens back. This creates incredible action economy. Research Voidwatch to start extracting promissory notes from players moving into your systems.

**Void Tether Map Control:**

Once you have Void Tether breakthrough, you can sever adjacencies strategically:
1. Block opponent invasion routes to your territory
2. Isolate enemy fleets from their supply lines
3. Prevent retreats from combat into safe systems
4. Control access to Mecatol Rex or objectives

Example: If an opponent needs to activate System A then System B, place void tether between them. They can no longer treat A and B as adjacent, requiring two activations instead of one movement.

**Dark Energy Tap Secret Cycling:**

Every tech you research draws a secret objective. This means:
- Research 3 techs by round 3 = see 3 secrets, choose 2 to keep
- By round 5, you've seen 5-6 secrets total
- This lets you hunt for easy secrets while discarding hard ones

Optimal use: Research techs in rounds where secret objectives would help you score that same round.

**Two-Promissory Diplomacy:**

You have Blood Pact and Dark Pact. Strategic distribution:
- **Blood Pact** to political ally who wants voting power
- **Dark Pact** to economic partner with high commodities

If both holders honor the pacts, you gain +4 votes when aligned politically and recurring trade good generation. If either attacks you, they lose their pact benefit.

## VIII. Objectives

### A. Objective Summary

**Strengths:** Empyrean excels at neighbor-based objectives with Nebula ability encouraging wide expansion. Influence spending is easy with many planets, and Xuange commander helps recover tokens for scoring flexibility. Structure objectives benefit from aggressive expansion patterns.

**Weaknesses:** Combat objectives are harder without direct military bonuses, requiring fleet investment. Tech diversity objectives can be challenging depending on your chosen paths, and resource spending may be difficult if you prioritize influence-heavy planets.

## IX. Alliance Priority

**Best Alliance Partners:**

1. **Winnu:** Weak faction benefits from your Aetherpassage and movement support; you benefit from their Mecatol focus

2. **Xxcha:** Defensive faction values Blood Pact voting power; mutual non-aggression works well

3. **Ghosts of Creuss:** Wormhole faction benefits from your Aetherstream; you benefit from wormhole access

4. **Arborec:** Slow faction desperately needs your movement support; you benefit from their bulk

5. **Yssaril:** Political faction values Blood Pact; diplomatic synergy

**Worst Alliance Partners:**

1. **L1Z1X Mindnet:** Aggressive faction will activate your systems, breaking both promissory notes

2. **Sardakk N'orr:** Combat faction doesn't benefit from your diplomatic abilities

3. **Mentak Coalition:** Pirates don't synergize with your diplomatic play style

## XI. End Notes

Empyrean are the faction for players who love spatial reasoning, diplomatic maneuvering, and long-term planning. You're not the flashiest faction - no war suns, no massive fleets, no instant-win abilities. You're the faction that controls the board through movement permission, toll collection, and strategic positioning.

The key to mastering Empyrean is understanding that adjacency is power. Every neighbor relationship is an opportunity to extract value through Aetherstream bonuses, Voidwatch tolls, or Aetherpassage permissions. Your commander requires neighboring everyone, which sounds restrictive but actually creates incredible action economy once unlocked.

Your biggest strength is flexibility through promissory notes and movement abilities. You can grant or deny passage, provide or withhold movement bonuses, and extract or forgive tolls based on political needs. This makes you invaluable as an ally and dangerous as an enemy.

When you nail Empyrean, you feel like the galaxy's air traffic controller. Movement happens because you allow it. Alliances form because you facilitate them. Objectives get scored because you positioned perfectly to neighbor everyone while maintaining defensive security. Your hero turn generates massive exploration value, potentially swinging the game through frontier token bonuses.

Empyrean don't conquer the galaxy - they network it, control it through adjacency, and profit from every ship that moves through their influence. And when victory comes, it's because you were everywhere, touched every conflict, and extracted value from every activation while opponents exhausted themselves fighting each other.
