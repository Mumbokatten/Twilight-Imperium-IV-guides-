---

## I. Introduction

The Vuil'raith Cabal are TI4's ultimate resource recyclers and gravity rift specialists. This faction excels at capturing enemy units destroyed in combat through Devour, using those captured units to produce for free via Amalgamation, and ignoring tech prerequisites through Riftmeld. Vuil'raith isn't about traditional economy—it's about converting enemy deaths into your production fuel, leveraging gravity rifts for mobility advantages, and scaling power through captured unit recycling.

The payoff? Watching opponents realize their destroyed ships become YOUR free production materials, seeing your dimensional tear space dock act as a gravity rift with +1 move for exiting ships, and capturing entire enemy fleets with your Hero. When you've captured 20+ units and produce massive fleets for free, economic dominance is absolute.

## II. Playstyle

Playing Vuil'raith Cabal is like being a cosmic scavenger that turns enemy losses into your gains. Your Devour captures enemy units destroyed in combat, your Amalgamation lets you spend captured units instead of resources for production, and your Riftmeld uses captured units to bypass tech prerequisites. You're not building traditional economy—you're stealing enemy units and recycling them into your own fleets.

The key strength of Vuil'raith is captured unit economy. Every enemy ship you destroy becomes free production fuel. One captured dreadnought = one free dreadnought you can produce later. Over a game, you'll capture 15-25 units, representing 30-60 resources of free production. This scales exponentially—the more you fight, the stronger your economy becomes.

Opponents will hesitate to attack you once they realize every ship they lose becomes your production fuel. That moment when you produce 3 dreadnoughts for free using captured units? Pure resource efficiency.

## III. The Basics

### A. Home System & Commodities

**Home System:** Acheron (4 resources / 0 influence = 4 optimal resources / 0 optimal influence)

**Commodities:** 2

**Notes:** Resource-heavy home system with 4 resources and ZERO influence. This is extreme—excellent for production, terrible for voting and political plays. Single-planet home system is easier to defend. Your 2 commodities are low for trading. You're built for military production, not politics.

### B. Starting Fleet

- 1 Dreadnought
- 1 Carrier
- 1 Cruiser
- 3 Fighters
- 3 Infantry
- 1 Space Dock

**Notes:** Strong starting fleet with a dreadnought (most factions start with carriers/cruisers only). The dreadnought gives you immediate combat power and BOMBARDMENT. Your carrier + cruiser provide mobility and capacity. 3 fighters and 3 infantry give you solid expansion capability. Very combat-ready R1.

### C. Starting Technologies

**Self-Assembly Routines (Red)** - After you place a space dock, you may place 1 PDS and 1 infantry from your reinforcements in the active system.

**Notes:** Excellent starting tech. Every time you build a space dock, get a free PDS + infantry. Over a game, this saves 4-6 resources (building 2-3 docks = 2-3 free PDS/infantry). Opens red tech paths for unit upgrades.

### D. Faction Abilities

**Devour (Faction Ability):** Capture your opponent's non-structure units that are destroyed during combat.

Your signature ability. When enemy units die in combat (space or ground), you capture them instead of them going to reinforcements. These captured units sit on your faction sheet and can be used for Amalgamation (free production) or Riftmeld (ignore tech prerequisites). Absolutely core to your faction identity.

**Amalgamation (Faction Ability):** When you produce a unit, you may return 1 captured unit of that type to produce that unit without spending resources.

Free production. When producing a dreadnought, return 1 captured dreadnought to produce it for 0 resources. This is insane—every captured unit = 1 free production of that type. Over a game with 20 captured units, you save 40-60 resources.

**Riftmeld (Faction Ability):** When you research a unit upgrade technology, you may return 1 captured unit of that type to ignore all of that technology's prerequisites.

Bypass tech prerequisites. Want Dreadnought II (requires 2 red techs)? Return 1 captured dreadnought, get Dreadnought II with ZERO prerequisites. This lets you skip entire tech trees and rush powerful unit upgrades.

### E. Leaders

**Agent - The Stillness of Stars:**

After another player replenishes commodities: You may exhaust this card to convert their commodities to trade goods and capture 1 unit from their reinforcements that has a cost equal to or lower than their commodity value.

Powerful economic disruption agent. When opponents refresh commodities (Trade strategy card), exhaust this to:
1. Convert their commodities to trade goods (preventing them from trading)
2. Capture 1 unit from their reinforcements (cost ≤ commodity value)

If Hacan refreshes 6 commodities, convert them to 6 TG (Hacan can't trade now) and capture 1 dreadnought/carrier/cruiser (cost ≤6) from their reinforcements. Brutal economic denial.

**Commander - That Which Molds Flesh:** *Unlock: Have units in 3 gravity rifts.*

When you produce fighter or infantry units: Up to 2 of those units do not count against your PRODUCTION limit.

Easy unlock (place units in 3 gravity rift systems). Once unlocked, when producing fighters/infantry, 2 don't count against PRODUCTION. If you have PRODUCTION 5 and produce 5 dreadnoughts (cost 20 resources, uses 5 production), you can also produce 2 fighters for free (don't count against limit). Excellent for fighter swarms and infantry spam.

**Hero - It Feeds on Carrion:** *Unlock: Have 3 scored objectives.* **Dimensional Anchor** - ACTION: Each other player rolls a die for each of his non-fighter ships that are in or adjacent to a system that contains a dimensional tear; on a 1-3, capture that unit. If this causes a player's ground forces or fighter to be removed, also capture those units. Then, purge this card.

Devastating mass capture hero. Every opponent rolls for EACH of their non-fighter ships in/adjacent to your dimensional tear space docks. On 1-3 (50% chance), you capture it. In a 6-player game with 3 dimensional tears, opponents might have 10-15 ships within range. You'll capture 5-10 ships plus their cargo (fighters/infantry). Absolutely game-ending economic swing.

### F. Promissory Note - **Crucible**

After you activate a system: Your ships do not roll for gravity rifts during this movement; apply an additional +1 to the move values of your ships that would move out of or through a gravity rift instead. Then, return this card to the Vuil'raith player.

Useful promissory for gravity rift navigation. Holder can move through gravity rifts safely (+1 move instead of rolling). Trade value: 2-3 TG. Best for mobile factions (Saar, Ghosts) who want to use gravity rifts.

### G. Alliance

When you produce ships, you may produce 1 additional fighter or infantry for its cost.

Standard production bonus. Useful for economic factions. Trade value: 3-4 TG or equivalent.

### H. Mech - **Reanimator**

Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | **Sustain Damage**

When your infantry on this planet are destroyed, place them on your faction sheet; those units are captured.

Excellent mech. When YOUR infantry die on this planet, you capture them (instead of returning to reinforcements). This means your dead infantry can be used for Amalgamation later (free infantry production). Essentially makes your infantry immortal through recycling—they die, you capture them, you produce them again for free.

### I. Flagship - **The Terror Between**

Cost: 8 | Combat: 5 (x2) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 3 | **Sustain Damage** | **BOMBARDMENT 5**

Capture all other non-structure units that are destroyed in this system, including your own.

Insane flagship. Captures ALL units destroyed in the system (enemy AND yours). This means:
1. Enemy ships destroyed = captured (normal Devour)
2. YOUR ships destroyed = captured (not normal—you recycle your own losses!)

If you lose a space battle but your flagship survives, you capture your own destroyed ships and can reproduce them for free later. You're turning losses into future gains. Incredible value.

### J. Dimensional Tear I - **Vuil'raith Space Dock**

Cost: 4 | **PRODUCTION 5**

This system is a gravity rift; your ships do not roll for this gravity rift. Place a dimensional tear token beneath this unit as a reminder. Up to 6 fighters in this system do not count against your ships' capacity.

Your unique space dock. Creates a gravity rift in the system (opponents moving through roll dice, you don't). Your ships exiting this system get +1 move (gravity rift bonus). 6 fighters don't count against capacity (free fighter storage). Excellent for defensive positioning and mobility.

**Strategic Value:**
- Build dimensional tear in forward position
- Opponents must roll to move through it (50% chance to lose ships)
- Your ships exiting get +1 move (mobility advantage)
- Free fighter storage (6 fighters = 3 capacity saved)

### K. Breakthrough - **Al'raith Ix Ianovar (R<>G)**

This breakthrough causes The Fracture to enter play without a roll, if it is not already in play. After this card enters play, move up to 2 ingress tokens into systems that contain gravity rifts. Apply +1 to the MOVE value of each of your ships that start their movement in The Fracture.

**R<>G Synergy:** Red and green technologies count as each other for prerequisites.

**Fracture Trigger:** Forces The Fracture (gravity rift cluster wormhole nexus) to enter play immediately. This creates a massive gravity rift network across the map.

**Ingress Movement:** Move up to 2 ingress tokens (wormhole entrances) to gravity rift systems. This lets you reposition the Fracture's wormhole connections.

**Movement Bonus:** Your ships starting in The Fracture get +1 move. Combined with gravity rift exit bonuses, your ships can move 3-4 spaces easily.

**R<>G synergy:** Self-Assembly Routines (R) counts as green, opening green tech paths.

**Strategic Value:** Creates a galaxy-wide wormhole network you control, gives you massive mobility advantage, and synergizes with your dimensional tears.

### L. Slice and Draft Considerations

Vuil'raith wants combat opportunities and gravity rift access:

**Speaker Order:**
- **Prefer positions 2-4** - Lets you grab Warfare or Leadership early.
- **First/last position acceptable** - Flexibility for aggressive plays.

**Slice Priorities:**
- **Gravity rifts in/near slice** - You benefit from gravity rifts (+1 move exiting). Opponents suffer (roll to move through).
- **High resource planets** - Need resources for initial production (before captured units accumulate).
- **Aggressive neighbors** - You WANT combat. More fights = more captured units.
- **Planet count (4-5 ideal)** - More planets = more expansion targets for dimensional tear placement.

**Slice Features to Avoid:**
- **Zero gravity rifts** - Wastes your gravity rift synergies and Commander unlock.
- **Influence-heavy slice** - You have 0 influence at home. Can't leverage influence.
- **Passive neighbors** - If no one fights you, you can't capture units. You need combat.

**Summary:**
Vuil'raith wants combat, gravity rifts, and resources. Your 0-influence home makes you terrible at politics but excellent at warfare. Embrace aggression, seek fights, capture units, recycle them into free production.

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

### A. First Turn Priorities

Your R1 priority order: **Warfare > Leadership > Technology**

Focus on:
1. **Warfare** - You want combat for Devour captures. Warfare enables aggressive plays.
2. **Leadership** - Command counters for expansion and production.
3. **Technology** - Begin tech path toward unit upgrades via Riftmeld.
4. **Trade** - Less useful (2 commodities only, 0 influence).

**Expansion Notes:** You have 1 dreadnought (slow but powerful), 1 carrier, 1 cruiser, 3 fighters, and 3 infantry. Strong combat fleet. Aim for 3-4 systems R1, prioritizing gravity rift systems for Commander unlock. Your dreadnought gives you immediate combat superiority over most R1 opponents.

### B. Political Weakness

0 influence at home means you're terrible at voting, can't use Diplomacy effectively, and struggle with influence-spending objectives. You need to expand to influence planets quickly or avoid political contests entirely.

**Mitigation:** Expand to cultural/influence-heavy planets R1-R2. Use Agent to disrupt opponent trade (converting commodities to TG denies them trading opportunities). Focus on military objectives, not political ones.

### C. Commander Unlock Requirement

Commander requires units in 3 gravity rifts. If your slice has 0-1 gravity rifts, this is very difficult. You may need to build dimensional tears in gravity rift systems or wait for Fracture (if using breakthrough).

**Mitigation:** Place dimensional tear space docks in gravity rift systems (counts as gravity rift). Use Fracture breakthrough to create more gravity rifts. Aim for Commander unlock R3-R4.

### D. Capture Dependency

Your economy depends on capturing units through combat. If you avoid fights or lose fights without destroying enemy units, you don't build captured unit reserves. This makes you weaker than traditional economic factions early.

**Mitigation:** Fight constantly R2-R4. Target weak opponents or contested systems. Even losing fights where you destroy 2-3 enemy ships builds your captured reserves. Use flagship to capture your own destroyed units (turning losses into gains).

---

## V. Technology

### A. Overview

You start with **Self-Assembly Routines (Red)** (free PDS + infantry when building space docks).

Your main tech path should focus on unit upgrades via Riftmeld (bypass prerequisites using captured units) and mobility techs for gravity rift synergy.

### B. Tech Path 1: Riftmeld Unit Upgrades (Standard)

**Starting Tech:** Self-Assembly Routines (R)

**Round 1: Carrier II (BBBB) - WITH RIFTMELD**
- Cost 3 | Combat 9 | Move 2 | Capacity 6
- **Why:** Riftmeld bypasses all prerequisites. Return 1 captured carrier → get Carrier II with ZERO tech requirements. Instant capacity and mobility upgrade.
- **Prerequisites:** None via Riftmeld (normally requires 2 blue)
- **Requirement:** Must have captured 1+ carriers by R2

**Round 2: Dreadnought II (YYYY) - WITH RIFTMELD**
- Cost 4 | Combat 5 | Move 2 | BOMBARDMENT 5 | Sustain Damage
- **Why:** Riftmeld bypasses prerequisites. Return 1 captured dreadnought → get Dreadnought II instantly. You start with a dreadnought, so capturing 1 enemy dreadnought enables this.
- **Prerequisites:** None via Riftmeld (normally requires 2 yellow)
- **Requirement:** Must have captured 1+ dreadnoughts

**Round 3: Gravity Drive (BB)**
- After you activate a system, apply +1 to the move value of 1 of your ships during this tactical action
- **Why:** Mobility for repositioning. Synergizes with gravity rift bonuses.
- **Prerequisites:** 2 blue (need blue techs)

**Round 4: Cruiser II (GGGB) OR Destroyer II (RR)**
- **Cruiser II:** Cost 2 | Combat 7 | Move 3 | CAPACITY 1
  - **Why:** Fast ships with capacity. Riftmeld using captured cruiser.
- **Destroyer II:** Cost 1 | Combat 8 | Move 2 | AFB 6 (x3)
  - **Why:** Cheap upgraded destroyers. Riftmeld using captured destroyer.

**Round 5+:** Dimensional Tear II (space dock upgrade) or flex techs

**Tech Requirements:**
- **Captured units (CRITICAL):** Must capture carriers, dreadnoughts, cruisers to use Riftmeld
- **Blue skip (helpful):** Accelerates Gravity Drive
- **Any color skip (bonus):** Helps with prerequisite techs you can't Riftmeld

**Pros:**
- Early unit upgrades via Riftmeld (bypass all prerequisites)
- Carrier II R2 and Dreadnought II R3 = massive power spike
- No need for traditional tech prerequisites
- Flexible tech path

**Cons:**
- Requires capturing specific unit types
- If you don't fight/capture units, Riftmeld is useless
- Delays economic techs (Sarween)

**Best For:** Aggressive games with lots of combat. Capture units R1-R2, Riftmeld into unit upgrades R2-R4, dominate with superior fleet.

---

### C. Tech Path 2: Gravity Rift Mobility (Alternative)

**Starting Tech:** Self-Assembly Routines (R)

**Round 1: Sarween Tools (Y)**
- When you use PRODUCTION, reduce combined cost by 1
- **Why:** Economic efficiency before captured units accumulate.
- **Prerequisites:** None (0)

**Round 2: Gravity Drive (BB)**
- +1 move to 1 ship per activation
- **Why:** Mobility for gravity rift synergy.

**Round 3: Fleet Logistics (BB)**
- Perform 2 actions per turn
- **Why:** Double actions for aggressive expansion and combat.

**Round 4: Dreadnought II (YYYY) - WITH RIFTMELD**
- Return captured dreadnought for instant upgrade

**Round 5+:** Flex

**Pros:**
- Early Sarween for economy
- Gravity Drive + Fleet Logistics for mobility and aggression
- Still uses Riftmeld for unit upgrades later

**Cons:**
- Delays unit upgrades to R4

**Best For:** Games where you need early mobility and economic consistency.

## VI. Strategy Cards

### A. Round One

Your R1 priority is aggression and expansion.

**R1 Priority Ranking:**

1. **Warfare** - Enables combat for Devour captures. Redistribution for aggressive plays.

2. **Leadership** - Command counters for expansion and production.

3. **Technology** - Begin tech path toward Riftmeld upgrades.

4. **Trade** - You have 2 commodities. Mediocre trade economy.

5. **Construction** - Build dimensional tear space docks forward.

6. **Politics** - Less useful (0 influence at home).

7. **Diplomacy** - Less useful (0 influence at home).

8. **Imperial** - Never R1.

### B. Generally (R2+)

**Love:**
- **Warfare** - Combat for Devour captures. Redistribution for aggression.
- **Leadership** - CCs for constant production and expansion.
- **Technology** - Riftmeld unit upgrades and tech progression.

**Good:**
- **Construction** - Build dimensional tear space docks (forward production + gravity rift zones).
- **Imperial** - Needed for scoring R3-R5.
- **Trade** - Refresh 2 commodities. Mediocre but necessary.

**Situational:**
- **Politics** - Only if you've expanded to influence planets.
- **Diplomacy** - Less useful until you have influence planets.

---

## VII. Intermediate

### A. Unit Composition

Your ideal fleet composition focuses on captured unit types and recyclable production:

**Preferred Units:**
- **Dreadnoughts** - Cost 4 each. Capturing 1 = 1 free dreadnought via Amalgamation. Excellent value.
- **Carriers** - Capacity for armies. Capturing 1 = 1 free carrier.
- **Cruisers** - Fast screening ships. Capturing 1 = 1 free cruiser.
- **Fighters/Infantry** - Spam these with Commander (2 don't count against production).

**Production Strategy:**
R2-R3: Produce normally (spend resources)
R4-R5: Produce using Amalgamation (return captured units for free production)

By R4, you should have 10-15 captured units. Use these for massive free production rounds.

### B. Point Planning

**Vuil'raith Cabal Christmas-Land Strategy Cards:**

| Round | Card             | Public Points | Secret Points | MR Points | Bonus | Total |
|-------|------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|-------|-------|
| One   | Warfare          | 0             | 0             | 0         | 0     | 0     |
| Two   | Leadership       | 1             | 0             | 0         | 0     | 1     |
| Three | Imperial         | 3             | 1             | 1         | 0     | 5     |
| Four  | Technology       | 4             | 2             | 1         | 1     | 8     |
| Five  | Imperial         | 6             | 3             | 2         | 1     | 12    |

You can only score 1 public objective per round (2 if you have Imperial). When you take Imperial, you can double score publics. Aim to score all 3 secrets across the game.

**Notes:**
- Vuil'raith scores through combat objectives (constant fighting for Devour)
- Technology R4 for Riftmeld unit upgrades
- Warfare R1-R2 for aggressive expansion and captures
- Hero R4 for mass capture (5-10 units captured = massive economic spike)

### C. Game Plan

**Strategic Approach:**

**Rounds 1-2: Aggressive Expansion & Capture Building**
- Take Warfare R1 for combat opportunities
- Expand to 4-5 systems, prioritizing gravity rift systems
- Fight weak neighbors or contest equidistant systems
- Capture 5-10 units by R2 (mix of ships and ground forces)
- Build 1-2 dimensional tear space docks in forward/gravity rift positions

**Rounds 3-4: Riftmeld Power Spike & Commander**
- Use Riftmeld R2-R3 to research Carrier II and Dreadnought II (bypass prerequisites)
- Unlock Commander R3 (units in 3 gravity rifts)
- Use Amalgamation to produce units for free using captured reserves
- Agent on opponents refreshing commodities (disrupt trade, capture units from reinforcements)
- Continue fighting to build captured reserves to 15-20 units

**Round 5: Hero Mass Capture & Domination**
- Hero R5: Each opponent rolls for ships near your dimensional tears (capture 5-10+ ships)
- Use Amalgamation to produce massive fleet using 20-30 captured units (free production worth 50+ resources)
- Commander enables fighter/infantry spam (2 don't count against production)
- Score final objectives via fleet dominance and planet control

**Key Strategic Principles:**
1. **Fight constantly** - Combat is your economy. More fights = more captured units.
2. **Use Riftmeld aggressively** - Research unit upgrades R2-R3 bypassing all prerequisites.
3. **Build dimensional tears forward** - Create gravity rift zones, deter enemies, boost your mobility.
4. **Amalgamation efficiency** - By R4, produce using captured units (save 30-50 resources).
5. **Hero timing R5** - Capture 5-10 enemy ships for massive economic swing.
6. **Flagship in major battles** - Capture your own destroyed ships (recycle losses).

**Notes:**
- **Gather a Mighty Fleet (5 dreadnoughts)** is EASY—you start with 1 dreadnought, Riftmeld into Dreadnought II, produce using Amalgamation
- **Make an Example (BOMBARDMENT)** is EASY—dreadnoughts have BOMBARDMENT
- Combat-heavy secrets strongly favor Vuil'raith
- All political secrets (Dictate Policy, Drive the Debate, Establish Hegemony) are VERY HARD due to 0 influence home

## IX. Alliance Priority

Trading for other factions' Alliance promissory notes (which give you access to their Commanders) can significantly boost your strategy. Here are the top alliances to prioritize:

**Super Top Tier:**
1. **Titans of Ul (Tungstantus)** - When you use PRODUCTION, gain 1 trade good. You produce constantly with Amalgamation = constant TG income.
2. **Hacan (Carth of Golden Sands)** - After you roll dice for combat/SPACE CANNON/AFB, reroll any number. Boosts your combat consistency.
3. **Sardakk N'orr (G'hom Sek'kus)** - During Commit Ground Forces, commit 1 ground force from each planet in active/adjacent systems. Helps invasions.
4. **Nomad (Navarch Feng)** - Produce flagship without spending resources. Synergizes with Amalgamation (save captured units for other ships).

**Really Useful:**
5. **Jol-Nar (Ta Zern)** - When units use PRODUCTION/AFB/BOMBARDMENT/SPACE CANNON, reroll any dice. Boosts production and combat.
6. **Muaat (Magmus)** - After you spend strategy token, gain 1 trade good. CC usage = TG income.
7. **L1Z1X (Il Na Viroset)** - During tactical actions, activate systems with your tokens and return both tokens. Flexibility for aggressive plays.
8. **Nekro Virus (Nekro Acidos)** - After you gain tech, draw 1 action card. Riftmeld tech gains = action card draws.

## X. End Notes

Vuil'raith Cabal is a top-tier aggressive faction with unique resource recycling mechanics. Your job is to:

1. **Fight constantly R1-R4** - Combat is your economy. Destroy enemies to capture units.
2. **Use Devour aggressively** - Capture 15-25 units over the game.
3. **Riftmeld into unit upgrades R2-R3** - Research Carrier II and Dreadnought II bypassing all prerequisites.
4. **Build dimensional tear space docks** - Forward production + gravity rift zones + fighter storage.
5. **Unlock Commander R3** - Units in 3 gravity rifts. Enables fighter/infantry spam (2 don't count against production).
6. **Amalgamation R4-R5** - Produce massive fleets using captured units (free production worth 40-60 resources).
7. **Hero R5** - Capture 5-10 enemy ships near dimensional tears for devastating economic swing.
8. **Flagship in major battles** - Capture ALL destroyed units including your own (recycle losses into future gains).

Don't let anyone tell you Devour is situational. You're converting enemy deaths into free production—that's exponential economic scaling. Fight aggressively, capture everything, use Riftmeld to bypass tech trees, and dominate through superior resource efficiency.

**DEVOUR. ASSIMILATE. DOMINATE.**
