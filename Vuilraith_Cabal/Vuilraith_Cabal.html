<h2 id="i.-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>The Vuil’raith Cabal are TI4’s ultimate resource recyclers and
gravity rift specialists. Every enemy unit destroyed becomes your
production fuel. Your dimensional tear space docks create gravity rifts
for enhanced mobility, and your captured unit economy scales
exponentially with each battle.</p>
<p>This faction rewards aggressive combat and resource efficiency. You
don’t build traditional economy—you steal it from your opponents. Every
destroyed ship is future production, every captured unit is saved
resources. The more you fight, the stronger you become.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-playstyle">II. Playstyle</h2>
<p>Playing Vuil’raith Cabal is like being a cosmic scavenger that turns
enemy losses into your gains. Your Devour captures enemy units destroyed
in combat, your Amalgamation lets you spend captured units instead of
resources for production, and your Riftmeld uses captured units to
bypass tech prerequisites. You’re not building traditional
economy—you’re stealing enemy units and recycling them into your own
fleets.</p>
<p>The key strength of Vuil’raith is captured unit economy. Every enemy
ship you destroy becomes free production fuel. One captured dreadnought
equals one free dreadnought you can produce later. This scales
exponentially—the more you fight, the stronger your economy becomes.</p>
<p>Opponents will hesitate to attack you once they realize every ship
they lose becomes your production fuel.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iii.-the-basics">III. The Basics</h2>
<h3 id="a.-home-system-commodities">A. Home System &amp;
Commodities</h3>
<p><strong>Home System:</strong> - <strong>Acheron:</strong> 4 resources
/ 0 influence - <strong>Total: 4 resources / 0 influence (4 optimal
resources / 0 optimal influence)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commodities:</strong> 2</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Resource-heavy home system with 4 resources
and ZERO influence. This is extreme—excellent for production, terrible
for voting and political plays. Single-planet home system is easier to
defend. Your 2 commodities are low for trading. You’re built for
military production.</p>
<h3 id="b.-starting-fleet">B. Starting Fleet</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 Dreadnought</li>
<li>1 Carrier</li>
<li>1 Cruiser</li>
<li>3 Fighters</li>
<li>3 Infantry</li>
<li>1 Space Dock</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Strong starting fleet with a dreadnought
(most factions start with carriers/cruisers only). 3 infantry, a
dreadnought, and a carrier all moving 2 steps gives you solid
flexibility. Very combat-ready R1.</p>
<h3 id="c.-faction-abilities">C. Faction Abilities</h3>
<p><strong>Devour (Faction Ability):</strong> Capture your opponent’s
non-structure units that are destroyed during combat.</p>
<p>Your signature ability. When enemy units die in combat (space or
ground), you capture them instead of them going to reinforcements. These
captured units sit on your faction sheet and can be used for
Amalgamation (free production) or Riftmeld (ignore tech prerequisites).
Devour allows you for pretty much costless wars—you should never have a
problem to produce for almost free from the early game. Once you start
producing, you never stop.</p>
<p><strong>Amalgamation (Faction Ability):</strong> When you produce a
unit, you may return 1 captured unit of that type to produce that unit
without spending resources.</p>
<p>Free production. When producing a dreadnought, return 1 captured
dreadnought to produce it for 0 resources. This is insane—every captured
unit = 1 free production of that type. Over a game with 20 captured
units, you save 40-60 resources.</p>
<p><strong>Riftmeld (Faction Ability):</strong> When you research a unit
upgrade technology, you may return 1 captured unit of that type to
ignore all of that technology’s prerequisites.</p>
<p>Unit upgrades are helpful to leverage your massive production.
Usually your tech stack will be very small, and the ability to skip
prerequisites opens up options. Do not overindex on this—you will need
to spend your focus elsewhere. You will win combats with upgrades or
not.</p>
<p><strong>Dimensional Tear (Special Unit):</strong> Your space docks
make the system a gravity rift. Your ships do not roll for this gravity
rift. Up to 6 fighters in the system don’t count against capacity.</p>
<p>Your dimensional tear space docks turn systems into gravity rifts for
mobility advantages. You don’t roll for your own gravity rifts, and
opponents moving through must roll. Place them in forward positions for
enhanced fleet movement.</p>
<h3 id="d.-starting-and-faction-technologies">D. Starting and Faction
Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Technologies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Self-Assembly Routines (R)</strong> - After 1 or more of your
units use PRODUCTION, you may exhaust this card to place 1 mech from
your reinforcements on a planet you control in that system. After 1 of
your mechs is destroyed, gain 1 trade good.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Solid starting tech. Place mech after
production for free. Gain TG when mechs die. Feel free to let mechs die
for TGs—you will be able to afford new mechs (might have some captured),
but TGs are in short supply.</p>
<p><strong>Faction Technologies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dimensional Tear II (YY):</strong> <em>Vuil’raith Space Dock
- PRODUCTION 7</em></p>
<p>This system is a gravity rift; your ships do not roll for this
gravity rift. Place a dimensional tear token beneath this unit as a
reminder. Up to 12 fighters in this system do not count against your
ships’ capacity.</p>
<p>Hard to get normally but crazy value if you get from Entropic Scar.
Having the 7 production and 2 bonus from Commander while every unit is
free—pretty crazy. The endless supply of free fighters able to sit and
defend your docks from being blockaded is helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Vortex (R):</strong> <em>ACTION: Exhaust this card to choose
another player’s non-structure unit in a system that is adjacent to 1 or
more of your space docks. Capture 1 unit of that type from that player’s
reinforcements.</em></p>
<p>Vortex is a stall—it gives less diplomatic anger than fighting for
the troops, but this is a bit overrated. Unless you feel like you really
don’t want to anger people and have good targets nearby your docks,
probably skip it and focus on unit upgrades.</p>
<h3 id="e.-leaders">E. Leaders</h3>
<p><strong>Agent - The Stillness of Stars:</strong></p>
<p>After another player replenishes commodities: You may exhaust this
card to convert their commodities to trade goods and capture 1 unit from
their reinforcements that has a cost equal to or lower than their
commodity value.</p>
<p>Use it to steal dreadnoughts and carriers from willing or unwilling
targets. Another economy boost to your production.</p>
<p><strong>Commander - That Which Molds Flesh:</strong> <em>Unlock: Have
units in 3 gravity rifts.</em></p>
<p>When you produce fighter or infantry units: Up to 2 of those units do
not count against your PRODUCTION limit.</p>
<p>Easy unlock—your dimensional tear space docks create gravity rifts,
helping you place units in 3 gravity rift systems. Once unlocked, when
producing fighters/infantry, 2 don’t count against PRODUCTION limit
(still cost resources). Very strong to emphasize your military advantage
with extra production capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Hero - It Feeds on Carrion:</strong> <em>Unlock: Have 3
scored objectives.</em> <strong>Dimensional Anchor</strong> - ACTION:
Each other player rolls a die for each of his non-fighter ships that are
in or adjacent to a system that contains a dimensional tear; on a 1-3,
capture that unit. If this causes a player’s ground forces or fighter to
be removed, also capture those units. Then, purge this card.</p>
<p>It usually only captures a few ships because there won’t be massive
capital fleets next to you. Getting a flagship or war sun is just a pipe
dream—it happens but rare. Just use whenever you feel a bit light on
captured units or save for when you got nothing else to do.</p>
<h3 id="f.-promissory-note---crucible">F. Promissory Note -
<strong>Crucible</strong></h3>
<p>After you activate a system: Your ships do not roll for gravity rifts
during this movement; apply an additional +1 to the move values of your
ships that would move out of or through a gravity rift instead. Then,
return this card to the Vuil’raith player.</p>
<p>Trade value 1-2 TG, but very useful if people need it for attacking
someone important. The bonus movement helps too.</p>
<h3 id="g.-alliance">G. Alliance</h3>
<p>Whoever holds your alliance card has your Commander (That Which Molds
Flesh - up to 2 fighters/infantry don’t count against PRODUCTION
limit).</p>
<p>When people have your alliance, they get to produce more like you.
Strong alliance and definitely only trade for one of the top ones.</p>
<h3 id="h.-mech---reanimator">H. Mech - <strong>Reanimator</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | <strong>Sustain Damage</strong></p>
<p>When your infantry on this planet are destroyed, place them on your
faction sheet; those units are captured.</p>
<p>Excellent mech. When YOUR infantry die on this planet, you capture
them (instead of returning to reinforcements). This means your dead
infantry can be used for Amalgamation later (free infantry production).
Essentially makes your infantry immortal through recycling—they die, you
capture them, you produce them again for free.</p>
<h3 id="i.-flagship---the-terror-between">I. Flagship - <strong>The
Terror Between</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 8 | Combat: 5 (x2) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 3 | <strong>Sustain
Damage</strong> | <strong>BOMBARDMENT 5</strong></p>
<p>Capture all other non-structure units that are destroyed in this
system, including your own.</p>
<p>Insane flagship. Captures ALL units destroyed in the system (enemy
AND yours). This means: 1. Enemy ships destroyed = captured (normal
Devour) 2. YOUR ships destroyed = captured (not normal—you recycle your
own losses!)</p>
<p>If you have massive fights with your flagship once, you will probably
never have to pay for plastic again.</p>
<h3 id="j.-breakthrough---alraith-ix-ianovar-rg">J. Breakthrough -
<strong>Al’raith Ix Ianovar (R&lt;&gt;G)</strong></h3>
<p>This breakthrough causes The Fracture to enter play without a roll,
if it is not already in play. After this card enters play, move up to 2
ingress tokens into systems that contain gravity rifts. Apply +1 to the
MOVE value of each of your ships that start their movement in The
Fracture.</p>
<p><strong>R&lt;&gt;G Synergy:</strong> Red and green technologies count
as each other for prerequisites.</p>
<p>The synergy won’t matter a lot—you won’t tech almost at all—but
guaranteeing The Fracture appears is very good for you. Being able to
decide that a portal to The Fracture appears on one of your docks for
strong movement. You can get neutral units, relics, and a point. In The
Fracture you are unmatched. If you want to play a “peaceful Cabal,” The
Fracture is the place to hang out.</p>
<h3 id="k.-slice-and-draft-considerations">K. Slice and Draft
Considerations</h3>
<p>Vuil’raith wants combat opportunities and gravity rift access:</p>
<p><strong>Speaker Order:</strong> All positions fine except 6th. No
neighbor is too scary—you are the least favorite neighbor.</p>
<p><strong>Slice Priorities:</strong> - <strong>Gravity rift
highway</strong> - Planets on the way to Mecatol with gravity rifts. -
<strong>High influence slice</strong> - All your units are free, you
need tokens. - <strong>Not aggressive neighbors</strong> - You will
bring it either way. - <strong>Wormholes</strong> - Nice for more
targets. - <strong>Entropic Scar</strong> - Very good. Lets you skip
spending on tech and get a sneaky Dimensional Tear II.</p>
<p><strong>Slice Features to Avoid:</strong> - <strong>High resource
slice</strong> - All your units are free, you need influence for tokens.
- <strong>Asteroids / Novas in the middle</strong> - Things that make
you position your space docks weirdly.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iv.-structural-weaknesses">IV. Structural Weaknesses</h2>
<h3 id="a.-first-turn-priorities">A. First Turn Priorities</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1 Priority Rankings:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Scoring</strong> - Try to get on it early. You don’t
excel at all objectives, so getting a head start is great.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expansion and Production</strong> - You will have an easy
time to take your entire slice, maybe even grab an extra equidistant
that isn’t “yours” (they all are, the rest don’t know it yet).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Breakthrough</strong> - Fine to grab Round 1 if you got
the opportunity. Getting to decide who can access The Fracture and not
is actually very strong.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology</strong> - Not needed. Wait until you have
units to upgrade. Try to play with very limited tech.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Expansion Notes:</strong> After you produce, you can almost
always take everything. No special tips needed. Construction from
yourself or Warfare from someone else.</p>
<h3 id="b.-diplomatic-struggles">B. Diplomatic Struggles</h3>
<p>You are the scary neighbor no one likes. Try to extort value from
neighbors trying to keep you in check. The problem is that even if you
are not winning, people still won’t make a lot of deals with you. Dinos
scary. Have to work around this best you can and grab extra planets to
get resources.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="v.-technology">V. Technology</h2>
<h3 id="a.-overview">A. Overview</h3>
<p>You start with <strong>Self-Assembly Routines (R)</strong> (place
mech after production, gain TG when mech destroyed).</p>
<p>Use Riftmeld to skip prerequisites on unit upgrades when you have
captured units. Try to play with very limited tech.</p>
<h3 id="b.-tech-path">B. Tech Path</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Tech:</strong> Self-Assembly Routines (R)</p>
<p><strong>Round 2:</strong> Carrier II (BB) - WITH RIFTMELD - Cost 3,
Combat 9, Move 2, Capacity 6 - <strong>Why:</strong> Transport capacity
for invasions. Use Riftmeld with captured carrier to skip prerequisites.
- <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> None via Riftmeld (normally requires 2
blue)</p>
<p><strong>Round 3:</strong> Dreadnought II (BBY) - WITH RIFTMELD - Cost
4, Combat 5, Move 2, Capacity 1, Sustain, BOMBARDMENT 5 -
<strong>Why:</strong> Capital ship upgrade. Use Riftmeld with captured
dreadnought to skip prerequisites. - <strong>Prerequisites:</strong>
None via Riftmeld (normally requires 2 blue + 1 yellow)</p>
<p><strong>Round 4:</strong> Destroyer II (RR) - WITH RIFTMELD - Cost 1,
Combat 8, Move 2, AFB 6 (x3) - <strong>Why:</strong> Cheap fleet power.
Use Riftmeld with captured destroyer to skip prerequisites. -
<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> None via Riftmeld (normally requires 2
red)</p>
<p><strong>Round 5+:</strong> Ignore tech. You’re done.</p>
<p>Having the freedom to get 3 unit upgrades and then not spend any more
thought on tech is fantastic.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vi.-strategy-cards">VI. Strategy Cards</h2>
<h3 id="a.-round-1">A. Round 1</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1 Priority Ranking:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Construction</strong> - For double dock (done with
commander unlock).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trade</strong> - To get some early bonus production. Lack
of TGs for rest of game can also be a nice boost to save a few.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leadership</strong> - Can always do stuff with tokens,
fight or produce.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Politics</strong> - To setup a strong round and some
bonus money selling speaker. Unlock breakthrough on all of
Trade/Leadership/Politics/Diplomacy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology</strong> - Vortex early doesn’t hurt but not
my favorite.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diplomacy</strong> - To get some bonus resources
early.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Warfare</strong> - For “I don’t want to have any friends”
going right into someone’s slice, then move again to kill them
round.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Imperial</strong> - Never Round 1.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Strategy Token Priority:</strong> Diplomacy and Warfare as
strategy tokens.</p>
<h3 id="b.-round-2">B. Round 2+</h3>
<p><strong>Love:</strong> - <strong>Leadership</strong> - Tokens for
constant production and expansion. - <strong>Imperial</strong> - Scoring
points.</p>
<p><strong>Good:</strong> - <strong>Politics</strong> - Control agendas
and speaker position. - <strong>Trade</strong> - Economy boost with 2
commodities. - <strong>Construction</strong> - Build more dimensional
tears for production and commander unlock.</p>
<p><strong>Situational:</strong> - <strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Only for
late game scoring. Who would attack you? - <strong>Warfare</strong> -
Should not be needed. - <strong>Technology</strong> - Fine to do
secondary.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vii.-intermediate">VII. Intermediate</h2>
<h3 id="a.-unit-composition">A. Unit Composition</h3>
<p><strong>Preferred Units:</strong> - <strong>Dreadnoughts</strong> -
Sustain Damage capital ships. Capture and reproduce for free. -
<strong>Carriers</strong> - Transport capacity for invasions. Capture
and reproduce for free. - <strong>Destroyers</strong> - Cheap fleet
power. Once upgraded, excellent AFB. - <strong>Infantry</strong> -
Commander bonus (2 don’t count against production). Spam these. -
<strong>Fighters</strong> - Commander bonus (2 don’t count against
production). Spam these. - <strong>Flagship</strong> - Captures all
units destroyed (including your own).</p>
<p><strong>Avoid:</strong> - <strong>Cruisers (unupgraded)</strong> -
Not worth it. - <strong>War Sun</strong> - Too expensive.</p>
<h3 id="b.-game-plan">B. Game Plan</h3>
<p><strong>Early Game (Rounds 1-2):</strong></p>
<p>Your early game is about aggressive expansion and building your
captured unit reserves. Expand to your entire slice and maybe grab an
extra equidistant. Build dimensional tear space docks in forward
positions to create gravity rift zones—aim to unlock Commander (units in
3 gravity rifts). Fight early to start capturing units—every destroyed
ship becomes future free production.</p>
<p><strong>Mid Game (Rounds 3-4):</strong></p>
<p>Use Riftmeld to get Carrier II, Dreadnought II, and Destroyer II
without prerequisites. Start producing units for free using Amalgamation
with your captured reserves. Consider pushing toward Mecatol Rex or
controlling The Fracture if you have the breakthrough. In The Fracture
you are unmatched—neutral units, relics, and points available.</p>
<p><strong>Late Game (Round 5+):</strong></p>
<p>You should have massive captured unit reserves. Produce entire fleets
for free using Amalgamation. Make plays for Styx and Mecatol to have a
big swing round. Try to not be beyond saving diplomatically at that
point. Score objectives and close out the game with your overwhelming
production advantage.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="viii.-objectives">VIII. Objectives</h2>
<h3 id="a.-objective-summary">A. Objective Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Excels at combat objectives with
aggressive playstyle. Aggressive expansion with free production supports
control objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Spending objectives are hard despite
free production. Tech objectives challenging with minimal tech.
Structure objectives difficult.</p>

<h2 id="ix.-alliance-priority">IX. Alliance Priority</h2>
<p>Alliance preference ranking based on commander utility:</p>
<p><strong>Top Tier:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Crimson Rebellion</strong> (Ahk Siever) - Gain 1 TG after
any combat (all players’ fights). Constant passive income.</li>
<li><strong>Titans of Ul</strong> (Tungstantus) - Gain 1 TG when using
production. You produce constantly = constant TG income.</li>
<li><strong>Muaat</strong> (Magmus) - Gain 1 TG after spending strategy
pool token. Passive income boost.</li>
<li><strong>Deepwrought</strong> (Aello) - Gain commodity/TG when others
research tech. Passive income you need.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Good:</strong></p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><strong>Empyrean</strong> (Xuange) - Return tokens when others move
into your systems. Double attack.</li>
<li><strong>Barony of Letnev</strong> (Rear Admiral Farran) - Gain 1 TG
after unit uses Sustain Damage. TG from dreadnoughts.</li>
<li><strong>Naaz-Rokha Alliance</strong> (Dart and Tai) - Explore planet
after conquering. Extra value from aggression.</li>
<li><strong>Winnu</strong> (Rickar Rickani) - +2 combat in
MR/home/legendary systems. Combat boost.</li>
<li><strong>Mentak Coalition</strong> (S’ula Mentarion) - Force opponent
to give PN after space combat win. Very frustrating to fight Mentak and
lose your plastic and your PN.</li>
<li><strong>Nomad</strong> (Navarch Feng) - Produce flagship without
spending resources. Saves 8 resources.</li>
</ol>

<p>Vuil’raith Cabal is the faction for players who love aggressive
combat and resource recycling. You’re not building traditional
economy—you’re stealing it from your enemies. Every destroyed ship
becomes your production fuel, and you’ll end the game with more free
units than anyone else.</p>
<p>Your biggest strength is captured unit economy. You don’t pay for
production like other factions. With Amalgamation and Devour, combat
isn’t just about winning—it’s about converting enemy losses into your
gains. Every fight makes you stronger, every captured unit is saved
resources. Your production scales infinitely with aggression.</p>
<p>When you master Vuil’raith Cabal, you feel like an unstoppable force
consuming the galaxy. The table will fear you, but they can’t stop you
from growing stronger with every battle. Vuil’raith Cabal builds massive
fleets—they just don’t pay for them.</p>
<p><strong>DEVOUR. ASSIMILATE. DOMINATE.</strong></p>
