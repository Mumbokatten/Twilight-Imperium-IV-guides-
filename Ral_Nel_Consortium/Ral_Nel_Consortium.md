# Ral Nel Consortium Guide

## I. Introduction

The Ral Nel Consortium (from Thunder's Edge expansion) are TI4's mobile structure specialists. They can transport PDS and Space Docks on their ships, trigger structure abilities remotely via Linkship destroyers, and respond defensively when opponents activate systems near them. Ral Nel rewards creative positioning, defensive play, and understanding when mobility beats static defenses.

## II. Playstyle

**"We are everywhere, and our infrastructure moves with us."** You're not building static PDS networks—you're creating mobile defensive platforms. Your destroyers trigger PDS Space Cannon from anywhere. Your structures fly with your fleets.

Core loop: Transport structures on ships → Position PDS/docks strategically → Use Linkships to trigger PDS remotely → Respond to opponent activations (Survival Instinct) → Redeploy structures as needed

You're a mid-tier faction that excels at:
- Defensive flexibility (mobile structures)
- Space Cannon coverage (Linkships trigger PDS anywhere)
- Reactive play (Survival Instinct moves ships when opponents activate near you)
- Economic efficiency (4 commodities + mobile space docks)

**Key Mindset:** Your structures aren't anchors—they're assets you relocate constantly. Think of PDS as mobile artillery and Space Docks as forward bases you move with your fleet.

## III. Components

### A. Starting Fleet
- 1 Dreadnought
- 1 Carrier
- 1 Destroyer (Linkship)
- 2 Fighters
- 4 Infantry
- 1 Space Dock
- 2 PDS

### B. Starting Technology
Choose 1 red or green technology with no prerequisites.

**Recommendations:**
- **Sarween Tools** (Yellow - but you can take with no prereq) - Best economic tech
- **Antimass Deflectors** - Synergizes with your PDS mobility
- **Neural Motivator** - Flexible opener
- **Psychoarchaeology** - If you want to go exploration route

### C. Home Systems
- **Mez Lo Orz Pei Zsha:** 2/1 (2 resources, 1 influence)
- **Rep Lo Orz Oet:** 1/3 (1 resource, 3 influence)
- **Total:** 3/4 (3 resources, 4 influence)

This is a **4-influence home system** (excellent for politics) but only 3 resources (below average for production).

### D. Faction Abilities

**Survival Instinct:** After opponent activates a system containing your ships, you may relocate up to 2 of your vessels into that system from adjacent systems lacking your command tokens.

**Miniaturization:** Your structures can be transported by any ships without requiring or consuming capacity. While in space, structures cannot use abilities. At the end of tactical actions, you may deploy structures from space onto controlled planets within their systems.

### E. Unique Units

**Linkship I (Destroyer Upgrade):**
- Cost: 1, Combat: 9, Move: 3
- Can use the SPACE CANNON ability of 1 of your structures in its space area
- Each structure can only be triggered once per round

**Linkship II:**
- Cost: 1, Combat: 8, Move: 4
- Can trigger same structure multiple times

### F. Leaders

**Agent - Kan Kip Rel:**
At the start of a player's turn: You may exhaust this agent to draw 2 action cards, then give 1 action card from your hand to that player.

**Commander - Watchful Ojz:** [Unlocks after passing last during Action Phase]
When retreating from space combat: You may retreat up to 2 ships to a system that does not contain another player's ships; if you do, place 1 command token from your reinforcements in that system.

**Hero - (Unnamed in source):** [Activates after scoring 3 objectives]
You may remove yourself from passed status, gain 2 command tokens, and draw 1 action card.

### G. Flagship - Last Dispatch
- Cost: 8
- Combat: 8 (x2)
- Move: 2
- Capacity: 4
- SUSTAIN DAMAGE
- **Ability:** When this ship retreats, you may destroy 1 ship in this system that does not have SUSTAIN DAMAGE.

### H. Mech - Alarum
- Cost: 2
- Combat: 6
- SUSTAIN DAMAGE
- **Ability:** After a combat round during ground combat, you may move up to 2 of your ground forces from planets in adjacent systems to this planet.

### I. Faction Technology - Nanomachines
**Prerequisites:** 2 Yellow
**Effect:** Exhaust this card to either:
1. Place 1 PDS from reinforcements on planet you control
2. Repair all units in 1 system
3. Trade 1 action card with another player

### J. Promissory Note - Nano-Link Permit
After the Ral Nel player activates a system:
Return this card to the Ral Nel player; you may move your structures from adjacent systems onto planets you control in the active system.

### K. Alliance

**Alliance Ability:**
*While you are neighbors with the Ral Nel player and their commander is unlocked:*
*When you declare a retreat, you may immediately retreat up to 2 of your ships from the active system to an adjacent system that does not contain another player's ships. Place a command token from your reinforcements into that system.*

Strong defensive alliance for factions that need flexible retreat options. Provides additional tactical flexibility and escape routes during combat. Particularly valuable for factions that struggle with being pinned down. Trade value: 2-3 TG.

### L. Breakthrough - Data Skimmer (Y<>G)

**Y<>G Synergy:** Yellow and green technologies count as each other for prerequisites.

**Effect:** During the action phase, if you have not passed, when other players would discard action cards, they are placed on this card instead. When you pass, take 1 action card from this card and discard the rest.

**Analysis:** Excellent action card economy tool. You collect every action card discarded by all players during the round, then cherry-pick the best one when you pass. This can give you critical cards like Direct Hit, Sabotage, or combat modifiers. The Y<>G synergy also helps with tech pathing.

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

### A. First Turn Priorities

As Ral Nel Consortium, your first turn priorities should reflect your mobile structure strategy and reactive movement. Here's the recommended ordering:

1. **Technology** - Miniaturization (transport structures with your carriers) is your defining tech. Prioritize researching this Round 2-3 to enable mobile space dock production. However, Round 1 focus on expansion and structure placement.

2. **Expansion + Production** - Build additional space docks and PDS Round 1 using Construction strategy card. Your Linkship destroyers trigger PDS globally when present. Place structures strategically for future Miniaturization transport. Your 3 resources from home are below average—expansion is critical.

3. **Breakthrough** - Survival Instinct (reactive movement when opponent activates adjacent system) requires board positioning first. Place structures near borders to enable future reactive repositioning. This comes after territorial control.

4. **Scoring** - Score structure objectives (4+ structures, structures on planets) easily due to mobile structure strategy. However, you need Round 2-3 infrastructure before these objectives appear. Focus on structure placement first.

### A. Low Starting Resources
3 resources at home is below average (most factions have 4-5). This delays your builds early game.

**Mitigation:** Expand aggressively R1-2 to compensate. Use 4 commodities via Trade for economic boost.

### B. Mobile Structures Complexity
Tracking which structures are in space vs on planets, which can be activated, which Linkships have triggered which PDS... this is cognitively demanding.

**Mitigation:** Practice. Use clear markers for structures in space vs deployed.

### C. Linkship Trigger Limit (Linkship I)
Each structure can only trigger once per round with Linkship I. This limits your Space Cannon spam early game.

**Mitigation:** Research Linkship II R3-4 for unlimited triggers per structure.

### D. Commander Unlock Challenge
Commander requires passing LAST during action phase. This means giving up initiative control.

**Mitigation:** Only pass last when you need Commander (defensive games) or when last-pass position is strategically valuable.

## V. Miniaturization Strategy

### A. Transporting Structures

Your structures can be transported by ANY ship without using capacity.

**Example:**
- 1 Carrier (Capacity 4) carries: 4 infantry + 2 PDS + 1 Space Dock
- Normal factions: Carrier can only carry 4 units
- You: Carry 4 units PLUS unlimited structures

**Applications:**
1. **Mobile PDS:** Transport PDS with fleet, deploy on conquered planets
2. **Forward Space Docks:** Transport dock with fleet, deploy when you've secured territory
3. **Rapid Redeployment:** Pick up structures from old planets, redeploy on new frontiers

### B. Deploying Structures

At end of tactical action, deploy structures from space onto planets you control in system.

**Optimal Workflow:**
1. Activate system
2. Fight/conquer
3. END OF ACTIVATION: Deploy PDS from carrier to planet
4. Next opponent's turn: That PDS is active and can Space Cannon

**Strategic Implications:**
- You can conquer planet and immediately have PDS defense on it
- Opponents can't easily take planets back (you've fortified instantly)
- You can relocate PDS from unimportant planets to frontlines constantly

### C. Structure Positioning

**Early Game (R1-2):**
- Keep PDS at home for defense
- Transport 1 Space Dock with forward fleet (for expansion production)

**Mid Game (R3-4):**
- Transport 1-2 PDS with main fleet
- Deploy PDS on conquered planets (instant defense)
- Keep mobile Space Dock near front lines

**Late Game (R5+):**
- 2-3 PDS transported with fleet (massive Space Cannon coverage via Linkships)
- Space Dock repositions to support new objectives

## VI. Linkship Destroyer Strategy

### A. Linkship I Mechanics

Your Linkship I can trigger Space Cannon of 1 structure in its space area. Each structure triggers once per round.

**Example:**
- You have 2 PDS in space with your fleet
- 1 Linkship I can trigger 1 PDS for Space Cannon
- If you have 2 Linkship Is, you can trigger both PDS

**Space Cannon Trigger Math:**
- 1 Linkship + 2 PDS = 2 Space Cannon shots (1 per PDS via 1 Linkship)
- 2 Linkships + 2 PDS = 4 Space Cannon shots (2 per PDS via 2 Linkships)

Wait, let me re-read... "can use the SPACE CANNON ability of 1 of your structures" means each Linkship triggers 1 structure once. So:
- 1 Linkship + 2 PDS = 1 Space Cannon shot (Linkship triggers 1 PDS)
- 2 Linkships + 2 PDS = 2 Space Cannon shots (each Linkship triggers 1 PDS)

### B. Linkship II Upgrade

Linkship II removes the "once per structure" limit. Now multiple Linkships can trigger the same structure.

**Example:**
- 3 Linkship IIs + 1 PDS in space
- All 3 Linkships trigger that 1 PDS
- 3 Space Cannon shots from 1 PDS

**Value:** Linkship II turns your small PDS count into devastating Space Cannon volleys.

### C. Optimal Linkship Usage

**Fleet Composition:**
- 4-6 Linkship destroyers
- 2-3 PDS in space (transported via carriers)
- Supporting carriers, cruisers, dreadnoughts

**Combat Sequence:**
1. Opponent activates your system
2. Your Linkships trigger PDS Space Cannon (4-6 shots before combat begins)
3. Space combat begins (you've already killed 2-4 enemy ships)
4. You have numerical advantage

**Linkship Positioning:**
- Always keep 2+ Linkships with your main fleet
- Keep 1-2 PDS transported with that fleet
- Mobile Space Cannon platform anywhere on the board

## VII. Survival Instinct (Defensive Response)

After opponent activates system with your ships, relocate up to 2 ships from adjacent systems (without your CCs) into that system.

**This is emergency reinforcement.**

### A. Defensive Applications

**Scenario 1: Opponent Attacks You**
- Opponent activates your system with 5 ships
- You have 3 ships in system + 2 ships in adjacent system
- Survival Instinct: Move 2 adjacent ships into system
- Now defending with 5 ships instead of 3

**Scenario 2: Speed Bump Ships**
- Place 1 destroyer in key system
- Opponent activates to pass through
- Survival Instinct: Bring 2 more ships from adjacent systems
- Now they're fighting 3 ships instead of 1 (delays them)

### B. Optimal Ship Placement

To maximize Survival Instinct:
- Place small fleets (1-2 ships) in 3-4 systems
- Keep these systems adjacent to each other
- When opponent attacks ANY of them, you can consolidate

**Example Map:**
```
System A: 2 ships
System B: 2 ships (adjacent to A and C)
System C: 2 ships
```

Opponent attacks System B:
- Survival Instinct: Move 2 ships from A + 2 ships from C into B
- Now defending with 6 ships total

### C. Limitations

- Can only move ships from systems WITHOUT your command tokens
- Only triggers when opponent activates (not when you activate)
- Maximum 2 ships moved

**Strategic Implication:** This is purely defensive. You can't use it offensively.

## VIII. Objectives

### A. Objective Summary

**Strengths:** Ral Nel dominates structure objectives with Miniaturization allowing PDS and space docks on every planet at minimal cost. Construct Massive Cities and Protect the Border are significantly easier than other factions, and mobility from Linkship supports territorial objectives.

**Weaknesses:** Combat objectives are challenging without direct military bonuses, requiring fleet investment. Resource spending can be difficult depending on slice composition, and tech diversity objectives may be harder with specialized tech focus.

### B. Stage I Objectives

| Stage I Objective                                                       | Status |

| Push Boundaries (Control more planets than each neighbor)               | 🟡     |
| Raise a Fleet (5+ non-fighter ships in 1 system)                        | 🟡     |

**Legend:** 🟢 Easy | 🟡 Moderate | 🔴 Difficult

Ral Nel has particular strengths with structure-based objectives. Miniaturization makes moving structures trivial, and mobile PDS networks make Build Defenses and Improve Infrastructure easier than most factions. Your 4-influence home system helps with Sway the Council.

Ral Nel has strong synergy with Turn their Fleets to Dust (Linkships provide abundant Space Cannon shots) and Establish a Perimeter (mobile PDS are core to your strategy). Commander retreat ability makes retreat-based objectives more feasible. Combat-focused secrets remain difficult since you're not a combat faction.

### D. Stage II Objectives

| Stage II Objective                                                       | Status |

| Rule Distant Lands (Control 2 planets in/adjacent to different players' HS) | 🔴     |
| Patrol Vast Territories (Units in 5 systems without planets)             | 🟡     |
| Control the Borderlands (Units in 5 edge systems not HS)                 | 🟡     |
| Subdue the Galaxy (Control 11 planets in non-home systems)               | 🟡     |
| Unify the Colonies (Control 6 planets with same trait)                   | 🟡     |
| Reclaim Ancient Monuments (Control 3 planets with attachments)           | 🟡     |
| Construct Massive Cities (Have 7+ structures)                            | 🟢     |

| Master of Sciences (Own 2 techs in each of 4 colors)                     | 🟡     |
| Revolutionize Warfare (Own 3 unit upgrade technologies)                  | 🟡     |

**Legend:** 🟢 Likely | 🟡 Possible | 🔴 Difficult

Ral Nel excels at structure objectives in Stage II. Construct Massive Cities and Protect the Border are significantly easier due to Miniaturization. Your mobility and defensive tools make positioning objectives feasible, but aggressive combat objectives remain challenging for this faction.

## IX. Technology

### A. Recommended Tech Paths

**Path 1: Linkship Rush**
1. Antimass Deflectors (Start - choose red tech)
2. Linkship I (R2)
3. Linkship II (R3-4)
4. Carrier II (R4-5)
5. Gravity Drive (R5)

**Path 2: Economic Build**
1. Sarween Tools (Start - if allowed)
2. Carrier II (R2-3)
3. Gravity Drive (R3-4)
4. Linkship I (R4)
5. AI Development Algorithm (R5)

**Path 3: Balanced**
1. Neural Motivator (Start)
2. Scanlink Drone Network (R2)
3. Linkship I (R3)
4. Carrier II (R4)
5. Linkship II (R5)

### B. Critical Technologies

**Linkship I:** Your faction identity. You MUST research this R2-4. Without Linkships, you're just a faction with mobile structures (weak).

**Linkship II:** Upgrades Linkship I. Multiple Linkships can trigger same PDS. This turns 2 PDS into 6-8 Space Cannon shots. Research R4-5.

**Antimass Deflectors:** Apply -1 to opponent Space Cannon rolls. Since you rely on Space Cannon defensively, denying enemy Space Cannon is valuable.

**Carrier II:** You transport structures constantly. Carrier II (Move 2, Capacity 8) is essential for rapid repositioning.

**Nanomachines (Faction Tech):** Deploy PDS, repair units, or trade action cards. The PDS deployment is most valuable (instant PDS on conquered planets).

**Sarween Tools:** You have 3 home resources (low). Sarween helps stretch production. If you can start with this, do it.

### C. Tech Skip Usage

You choose 1 red or green tech with no prerequisites at start.

**Best Choices:**
1. **Sarween Tools (Yellow - need to check if you can take this)** - If allowed, this is #1
2. **Antimass Deflectors (Red)** - Space Cannon defense
3. **Plasma Scoring (Red)** - Opens path to Linkship I/II
4. **Neural Motivator (Green)** - Flexible

## X. Strategy Cards

### A. Round 1

Your R1 priority is accelerating toward Linkship I and establishing mobile structure network.

**Round 1 Priority Ranking:**

1. **Trade** - 4 commodities + you're excellent trade partner. Economic engine foundation.

2. **Technology** - You need to accelerate toward Linkship I. Mandatory tech path.

3. **Politics** - 4 influence home makes you strong politically. Agenda control.

4. **Leadership** - CCs for expansion + Survival Instinct uses.

5. **Warfare** - Defensive unlock for Survival Instinct reinforcements.

6. **Construction** - You have mobile structures; less need for this.

7. **Imperial** - Unlikely to score R1.

8. **Diplomacy** - Survival Instinct provides defensive response; Diplomacy is redundant.

### B. Round 2+

**Love:**
- **Trade** - 4 commodities + economic engine. Excellent trade partner value.
- **Technology** - Linkship I/II are mandatory techs. Critical for mobile structure strategy.
- **Politics** - 4 influence home + agenda control.
- **Leadership** - CCs for expansion + Survival Instinct uses.
- **Warfare** - Unlock systems for reinforcement/Survival Instinct.
- **Imperial** - Points are points. Needed rounds 3-5.

**Like:**
- **Construction** - Mobile structures make Construction less critical, but objectives may require it.
- **Diplomacy** - Additional protection (but Survival Instinct is better).

## XI. Agent (Kan Kip Rel)

At start of player's turn, exhaust Agent: Draw 2 action cards, give 1 to that player.

**This is action card generation + trading.**

**Optimal Usage:**
- Draw 2, keep best 1, give worst 1 to another player
- Trade agent uses: "I'll agent you R2 if you vote my way on agendas"
- Generate extra action cards for yourself

**Value:**
- You net +1 action card per use
- Other player gets +1 action card (they value this)
- Political trading chip

**Timing:**
- Use R2-5 when action cards matter most
- Trade to players before their critical turns ("I'll agent you before your turn if you don't attack me")

## XII. Commander (Watchful Ojz)

Unlocks after passing last during Action Phase.

When retreating: Retreat up to 2 ships to system without enemy ships, place 1 CC from reinforcements there.

**This is enhanced retreat.**

**Applications:**
1. **Retreat to Safety:** Lose space combat, retreat 2 ships to safety, place CC to hold system
2. **Tactical Repositioning:** Retreat ships to staging system for future assault
3. **CC Generation:** Gain 1 CC from reinforcements (minor economic benefit)

**Unlock Challenge:**
- Requires passing LAST
- This means giving up initiative control
- Usually opponents prefer to pass last (Speaker advantage)

**When to Unlock:**
- R3-4 in defensive games (you're being attacked frequently)
- When you don't need early initiative
- When last-pass position has strategic value (you want to act last next round)

**Post-Commander Strategy:**
- Fight battles you can lose (retreating with Commander is valuable)
- Use retreat to reposition fleets without spending CCs
- Generate CCs via retreats

## XIII. Hero (Unnamed)

Activates after scoring 3 objectives.

Remove yourself from passed status, gain 2 CCs, draw 1 action card.

**This is an extra turn.**

**Optimal Timing:**
- R5 after passing but opponents are still active
- You've passed, seen their moves, now you un-pass and take optimal action
- Gain 2 CCs (1 strategy + 1 tactic) to enable this action

**Applications:**
1. **Objective Steal:** Opponent is about to score objective, you un-pass and score it first
2. **MR Theft:** Opponent takes MR, you un-pass and take it from them
3. **Final Assault:** You've passed but see opening, un-pass and attack

**Strategic Value:**
- Essentially gain 1 extra turn R5 (game-winning)
- Opponent thinks you're done, you surprise them
- 2 CCs + 1 action card = you have resources for meaningful action

## XIV. Flagship (Last Dispatch)

Combat: 8(x2), Move: 2, Capacity: 4, Sustain Damage

**Ability:** When retreating, destroy 1 non-Sustain ship in system.

**This is a parting shot.**

**Applications:**
1. **Retreat with Value:** Lose combat, retreat, kill 1 enemy ship as you leave
2. **Trade Up:** Your flagship takes damage, retreat, kill enemy dreadnought on way out (you saved flagship, they lost dreadnought)
3. **Deterrent:** Opponents hesitate to attack flagship (even if they win, you'll kill one of their ships)

**Optimal Usage:**
- Engage in fights you can't win
- Use Sustain to absorb hit
- Retreat, kill enemy's most valuable ship
- You've traded 0 ships for 1 enemy ship

**Combo with Commander:**
- Commander lets you retreat 2 ships + place CC
- Flagship retreats, kills 1 ship
- You've retreated 3 ships, killed 1 ship, placed CC

## XV. Mech (Alarum)

Combat: 6, Sustain Damage

**Ability:** After combat round in ground combat, move up to 2 ground forces from adjacent systems to this planet.

**This is ground force reinforcement.**

**Applications:**
1. **Defensive:** Enemy invades planet with mech, mid-combat bring 2 infantry from adjacent systems (suddenly you have numerical advantage)
2. **Offensive:** You invade with mech + 1 infantry, mid-combat bring 2 more infantry (3v2 instead of 1v2)
3. **Sustained Invasions:** Attack planet, bring mech, reinforcements arrive mid-combat

**Optimal Placement:**
- On border planets (likely to be invaded)
- On key defensive planets (MR, legendaries)
- With invasion forces (reinforcement mid-combat)

## XVI. Promissory Note (Nano-Link Permit)

After Ral Nel activates system, return card: Move your structures from adjacent systems onto planets you control in active system.

**This lets other players mimic your Miniaturization.**

**Trading Value:**
- Other players value mobile structures
- Trade for Alliance promissories, political support, or trade goods
- "I'll let you move structures if you vote X way"

## XVII. Advanced Strategies

### A. Mobile PDS Fortress

**Strategy:**
- Build 3-4 PDS total
- Research Linkship II
- Transport all PDS with main fleet (3-4 carriers)
- Position 4-6 Linkship destroyers with fleet

**Result:**
- Your fleet generates 12-16 Space Cannon shots per combat (4 PDS x 3-4 Linkships each)
- Opponents need overwhelming force to attack you
- You're a mobile fortress

**Applications:**
- Control Mecatol Rex with this fleet (unkillable)
- Threaten opponents (they can't defend against this much Space Cannon)
- Score control objectives (you can hold any system)

### B. Hit-and-Run Warfare

**Strategy:**
- Attack with fleet + structures
- Win space combat (likely, due to Space Cannon advantage)
- Deploy structures on conquered planets
- Next turn: Opponent counter-attacks, your PDS defends
- If you lose, Survival Instinct brings reinforcements
- If you lose badly, retreat with Flagship (kill 1 ship) + Commander (retreat safely)

**Result:**
- You're attacking constantly but rarely losing ships
- Opponents exhaust resources counter-attacking
- You're expanding efficiently

### C. Last-Pass Commander Unlock

**Strategy:**
- R3: Deliberately pass last
- Unlock Commander
- R4-5: Use enhanced retreats constantly

**Tactics:**
- Bait opponents into attacking (you'll retreat with advantage)
- Fight unwinnable battles (retreat, kill 1 ship with Flagship, reposition 2 ships with Commander)
- Deny opponents easy victories

## XVIII. Faction Matchups

### Ral Nel vs Titans of Ul
**Difficulty: Medium**

Titans have static PDS networks. You have mobile PDS.

**Strategy:**
- Avoid Titans' PDS range
- Use Linkships to match their Space Cannon output
- Your mobility > their static defense

### Ral Nel vs Argent Flight
**Difficulty: Medium**

Argent is aggressive. Survival Instinct helps you defend.

**Strategy:**
- Place small fleets in multiple systems
- When Argent attacks, Survival Instinct reinforces
- Linkship Space Cannon kills Strike Wing Alphas before combat

### Ral Nel vs Nekro
**Difficulty: Hard**

Nekro wants to kill your ships for tech. You want to avoid combat.

**Strategy:**
- Use Survival Instinct defensively (reinforce when attacked)
- Retreat with Flagship/Commander (deny Nekro tech stealing)
- Pay Nekro off to attack others

### Ral Nel vs Saar
**Difficulty: Medium-Hard**

Saar has mobile space docks. You have mobile everything.

**Strategy:**
- You're both mobile
- Use Linkships for Space Cannon advantage (Saar doesn't have this)
- Avoid direct conflict; out-expand Saar

## XIX. Common Mistakes

### 1. Forgetting to Deploy Structures
"I transported PDS but forgot to deploy it at end of activation." Your PDS stays in space (useless).

**Correct:** Always deploy structures at end of tactical action.

### 2. Not Researching Linkship I/II
"I'll skip Linkships and focus on other tech." You're wasting your faction abilities.

**Correct:** Linkship I by R3, Linkship II by R5. Non-negotiable.

### 3. Over-Extending Structures
"I'll transport all 4 PDS with my fleet!" Now you have no home defense.

**Correct:** Transport 2 PDS max. Leave 2 at home.

### 4. Not Using Survival Instinct
"I didn't have ships adjacent so I couldn't use it." Place ships in adjacent systems specifically for this.

**Correct:** Spread ships across 3-4 adjacent systems to maximize Survival Instinct.

### 5. Passing Early (Not Unlocking Commander)
"I'll pass early for better initiative." You'll never unlock Commander.

**Correct:** Pass last at least once (R3-4) to unlock Commander.
