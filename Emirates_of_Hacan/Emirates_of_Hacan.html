<h2 id="i.-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>The Emirates of Hacan are TI4’s master merchants—a faction for
players who understand that everything has a price, and you can afford
to pay it. While other factions scrape together resources and ration
their economies, you’re building an empire on pure wealth. You’re the
galactic marketplace, the faction that turns every negotiation into
profit and every deal into leverage.</p>
<p>This is a faction about putting coin above all else. Short-term
gains, long-term investments, political favors—it all flows through you.
Being a skilled merchant means understanding value: when to spend, when
to save, and when to buy exactly what you need to win. You don’t conquer
the galaxy through military might or technological supremacy. You buy
your way to victory, one trade at a time.</p>
<p>Watch opponents realize too late that they’ve been funding your
empire all along. Convert overwhelming wealth into a fleet from nothing.
Casually outbid everyone at the political table with trade goods to
spare. You don’t fight for resources—you negotiate for them, then use
that wealth to secure victory.</p>
<p><strong>“A wealthy man can err with impunity.”</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="ii.-playstyle">II. Playstyle</h2>
<p>Playing Hacan means operating as the galaxy’s central bank. You’re
not just rich—you’re the person everyone needs to trade with to fuel
their own economies. Your wealth generation happens automatically and
constantly, giving you resources other factions simply can’t match. This
economic surplus translates into everything: bigger fleets, stronger
political influence, and the flexibility to pivot toward whatever
objectives appear.</p>
<p>Your early game is about establishing dominance through trade. Lock
in favorable agreements, spread your economic influence across the
table, and start accumulating the wealth that defines your faction.
You’re producing units more efficiently than almost anyone else, so use
that advantage to expand and secure your position.</p>
<p>As the game progresses, your wealth becomes political power. You’ll
reach a point where you can simply buy votes, dominating the agenda
phase through pure economic might. Your trade influence lets you broker
deals between other players, extracting value from negotiations you’re
not even part of. You’re not the strongest military faction, but you can
afford to build whatever fleet you need when you need it.</p>
<p>Your endgame is about converting overwhelming economic advantage into
victory. You can produce an entire fleet for free in a single
activation, swap strategy cards to get exactly what you need, and
outspend everyone at the political table. Use your wealth to buy
support, bribe opponents away from conflict, and secure the path to
victory. Other factions fight for the throne—you purchase it.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iii.-the-basics">III. The Basics</h2>
<h3 id="a.-home-system-commodities">A. Home System &amp;
Commodities</h3>
<p><strong>Home System:</strong> 3 planets - <strong>Hercant:</strong> 1
resource / 1 influence = 0.5 optimal resource + 0.5 optimal influence -
<strong>Arretze:</strong> 2 resources / 0 influence = 2 optimal
resources - <strong>Kamdorn:</strong> 0 resources / 1 influence = 1
optimal influence - <strong>Total: 3 resources / 2 influence (2.5
optimal resources / 1.5 optimal influence)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commodities:</strong> 6</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Your home system is one of the worst in the
game. Your highest single-planet production is only 2 resources
(Arretze), giving you weak production capacity. With only 2 total
influence, you can’t reach the 3 influence threshold for a bonus command
token. Three separate planets means you have no realistic defense
possibility against invasions. This home system causes you more
headaches than joy.</p>
<p>What makes this faction tick is your 6 commodities—the highest in the
game. Your wealth comes from trade, not from your pathetic home
system.</p>
<h3 id="b.-starting-fleet">B. Starting Fleet</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 Carriers (capacity 12 total)</li>
<li>1 Cruiser</li>
<li>2 Fighters</li>
<li>4 Infantry</li>
<li>1 Space Dock</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Solid starting fleet—not very strong
militarily, but good for expansion. Two carriers with strong transport
capacity, combined with your flexible economy and strong tech start,
means you can usually claim 3 systems on Round 1.</p>
<h3 id="c.-faction-abilities">C. Faction Abilities</h3>
<p><strong>Masters of Trade:</strong> You do not have to spend a command
token to resolve the secondary ability of the “Trade” strategy card.</p>
<p>Very good ability that lowers the value of the Trade strategy card
for everyone else—you always get the refresh without spending a token.
Every round someone takes Trade, you refresh your 6 commodities for free
while other factions must spend a command token (limiting their
activations) or skip the refresh entirely. You never have to worry about
spending that token.</p>
<p><strong>Guild Ships:</strong> You can negotiate transactions with
players who are not your neighbor.</p>
<p>Standard rules only allow trading with neighbors. You ignore this
restriction entirely, allowing you to broker deals with anyone at the
table. This makes you the galactic marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>Arbiters:</strong> When you are negotiating a transaction,
action cards can be exchanged as part of that transaction.</p>
<p>Commonly underutilized ability. Trading action cards requires knowing
who wants what card at what time, which takes attention and table
awareness. The downside is you spoil your cards when trying to sell
them—revealing what’s in your hand gives away tactical information. But
if you spend the game actively trying to pawn off action cards (or
buying them from others), you can make a lot of profit. Action cards
have real value—you just need to find the right buyer at the right
moment.</p>
<h3 id="d.-starting-and-faction-technologies">D. Starting and Faction
Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Technologies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Antimass Deflectors:</strong> Your ships can move through
asteroid fields. Apply -1 to SPACE CANNON rolls against your units.</p>
<p><strong>Sarween Tools:</strong> When you use PRODUCTION, reduce the
combined cost of produced units by 1.</p>
<p>Great starting techs. Antimass Deflectors is solid for slice
considerations—gives flexible mobility through asteroid fields. Sarween
Tools provides value on every activation with production, effectively
giving you 1 free resource per build. Strong foundation for your
economy.</p>
<p><strong>Faction Technologies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Quantum Datahub Node (YYYY):</strong> <em>At the end of the
strategy phase, you may spend 1 token from your strategy pool and give
another player 3 of your trade goods. If you do, give 1 of your strategy
cards to that player and take 1 of his strategy cards.</em></p>
<p>Tier 4 yellow tech—pricey, but what is cost to a wealthy man? Swap
strategy cards with other players for 1 strategy token and 3 trade
goods. Can you put a price on winning the game? The flexibility to take
exactly the strategy card you need in a critical round can be the
difference between victory and defeat.</p>
<p><strong>PRODUCTION Biomes (GG):</strong> <em>ACTION: Exhaust this
card and spend 1 token from your strategy pool to gain 4 trade goods and
choose 1 other player; that player gains 2 trade goods.</em></p>
<p>Green tech with no synergy with your other tech paths. Not good
enough to research—never go for this. If you get it for free from
Entropic Scar, obviously it’s a net positive. When you use it, negotiate
the split: whoever gets the 2 trade goods can give you back 1 for a 5/1
split, or keep it 4/2 but owe you a favor. You’re a merchant—always
broker the best deal.</p>
<h3 id="e.-leaders">E. Leaders</h3>
<p><strong>Agent - Carth of the Golden Sands:</strong> During the action
phase, you may exhaust this card to gain 2 commodities or replenish
another player’s commodities.</p>
<p>Your agent generates 2 commodities on demand or refreshes another
player’s commodities. Always try to find the player with the highest
commodity count (usually 4) and refresh them for a negotiated split.
Offer a 3/1 deal: you get 3 trade goods back, they keep 1 as a goodie.
You’re turning your agent into 3 trade goods while giving them
value—classic merchant tactics.</p>
<p><strong>Commander - Gila the Silvertongue:</strong> -
<strong>Unlock:</strong> Have 10 trade goods - <strong>Ability:</strong>
When you cast votes, you may spend any number of trade goods; cast 2
additional votes for each trade good spent.</p>
<p>Commonly unlocked by offering to send the Trade card holder’s debt
through you—at that moment, combined with your own 6 commodities, you’ll
probably be above 10 trade goods. The conversion rate (1 TG for 2 votes)
is usually a bit too pricey to spend freely, but on important agendas
people have to vote extra to make sure you don’t throw a couple of coins
in to move the scales. Your commander turns wealth into political
leverage—the threat alone changes how people vote.</p>
<p><strong>Hero - Harrugh Gefhara:</strong> - <strong>Unlock:</strong>
Have 3 scored objectives - <strong>Galactic Securities Net:</strong>
When 1 or more of your units use PRODUCTION, you may reduce the cost of
each of your units to 0 during this use of PRODUCTION. If you do, purge
this card.</p>
<p>Your hero is incredible—between ~15-35 resources of value depending
on your production capacity. That’s a crazy amount of plastic for free.
The problem is getting War Sun tech if you want to maximize the hero
value, then getting it out early enough for the War Sun to actually do
something. Worst case scenario? You still get an incredible defensive
fleet for zero cost. Best case? You swing the entire game with
overwhelming force in a single activation.</p>
<h3 id="f.-promissory-note">F. Promissory Note</h3>
<p><strong>Trade Convoys:</strong> Place this card faceup in your play
area. While this card is in your play area, you may negotiate
transactions with players who are not your neighbor. If you activate a
system that contains 1 or more of the Hacan player’s units, return this
card to the Hacan player.</p>
<p>Maybe sell? If people are very friendly at the table, maybe it
doesn’t matter. But this really reduces your position as the merchant
station for all deals to flow through—you lose the ability to put your
thumb on the scale. When you control who can trade with whom, you
extract value from every negotiation. Give that up, and you’re just
another faction with trade goods.</p>
<h3 id="g.-alliance">G. Alliance</h3>
<p><strong>Alliance Ability:</strong> <em>While the Hacan player’s
commander is unlocked:</em> When you cast votes, you may spend any
number of trade goods; cast 2 additional votes for each trade good
spent.</p>
<p>One of the worst alliances in the game. People are generally not rich
enough to leverage this ability—most factions don’t have enough trade
goods sitting around to make spending them for votes worthwhile. Can be
used to secure a critical agenda if the buyer has resources. Best
strategy: sell it during the agenda phase on a specific important agenda
when it has immediate value to someone.</p>
<h3 id="h.-mech">H. Mech</h3>
<p><strong>Pride of Kenara:</strong> Cost 2, Combat 6, Sustain
Damage</p>
<p>This planet’s planet card may be traded as part of a transaction. If
you do, move all of your units from this planet to another planet you
control.</p>
<p>Your mechs enable trading planet cards (normally not allowed).
Structures also move when you trade the planet—you can move a space dock
to a surprise location, then make a big production there immediately.
Beyond the surprise tactical value, this lets you temporarily trade
planets for massive value then reclaim them later, or genuinely trade
territory as part of diplomatic agreements.</p>
<h3 id="i.-flagship">I. Flagship</h3>
<p><strong>Wrath of Kenara:</strong> Cost 8, Combat 7 (x2), Move 1,
Capacity 3, Sustain Damage</p>
<p>After you roll a die during a space combat in this system, you may
spend 1 trade good to apply +1 to the result.</p>
<p>Too costly for the ability it provides. Sure, you can spend a trade
good or two if it makes sense in a critical moment, but if you’re
relying on trade goods for a 0.1 increase per roll, that combat wasn’t
very good to begin with. Build this if you need flagship objectives or a
sustain damage ship—not because the ability is worth 8 resources.</p>
<h3 id="j.-breakthrough">J. Breakthrough</h3>
<p><strong>Auto-Factories:</strong> R&lt;&gt;Y (Red-Yellow synergy)</p>
<p>When you produce 3 or more non-fighter ships, place 1 command token
from your reinforcements into your fleet pool.</p>
<p>Creates a lot of economic power—consistently getting you 1-2 fleet
tokens per round. Combined with your wealth, you can afford to produce
3+ ships frequently.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced tricks:</strong> You can produce 3+ ships and then
delete one (like a destroyer) to convert 1 resource into a fleet
token—useful when you need tokens more than ships.</p>
<p>Your breakthrough token appears before the fleet token check. If you
have 2 fleet tokens, you can build 3 ships, trigger the breakthrough
(now at 3 tokens), and end at 3/3—perfectly legal. Without breakthrough,
you’d be over the fleet limit.</p>
<h3 id="k.-slice-and-draft-considerations">K. Slice and Draft
Considerations</h3>
<p><strong>Speaker Priority:</strong> Anything top 5</p>
<p>As long as you’re not last pick, you’re fine. What matters more is
having a friendly neighbor for board positioning.</p>
<p><strong>Priorities:</strong> - <strong>Isolated slice if
possible</strong> - You can trade with anyone regardless of distance, so
isolation doesn’t hurt your economy. No need to worry about a neighbor
who can’t reach you. Being isolated = safe. - <strong>Valuable systems
nearby home</strong> - Not in equidistant. You want strong systems you
can claim without immediate competition. - <strong>High optimal
total</strong> - Try to get high optimal resources and influence. Trade
goods help, but they can’t do everything—having rich systems matters a
lot. Your slice doesn’t need balance (equal resources/influence), just
high totals. - <strong>Path to Mecatol Rex</strong> - Need a way to
reach Mecatol for potential custodian grab. You’re not holding it
long-term—just grabbing the bonus point.</p>
<p><strong>Nice to Have:</strong> - Yellow or red tech skip (enables War
Sun + hero play for maximum value) - Trait symmetry for objectives -
Entropic Scar (you have plenty of tokens to spend for free faction tech)
- Good resource planet to put forward space dock (you need production
capacity beyond home)</p>
<p><strong>Avoid:</strong> - Equidistant systems (especially high-value
ones—those cause the most conflict) - Ultra-low optimal slices (even
with trade goods, you need production base) - Highly aggressive neighbor
positioning</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iv.-structural-weaknesses">IV. Structural Weaknesses</h2>
<h3 id="a.-first-turn-priorities">A. First Turn Priorities</h3>
<p>As Emirates of Hacan, your first turn priorities:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Scoring</strong> - You need to get started early. Your
economic engine is good all game, but it’s best in the early rounds. You
rarely come from behind—you stay at the front. Score territorial
objectives while your economy gives you the edge.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology</strong> - Start your tech path early. You
begin with excellent starting tech position (Sarween Tools + Antimass
Deflectors). Push toward Gravity Drive (B) for custodian grab and early
mobility, or get started on War Sun (RRRY) prereqs to maximize impact of
your hero.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expansion + Production</strong> - With 2 starting
carriers and strong early economy, expand to claim 2-3 systems. Your
wealth funds the expansion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Breakthrough</strong> - Auto-Factories is solid but lower
priority. Sometimes you can’t leverage it Round 1 anyway—you’re rich
enough to do a pricier expedition Round 2 instead. Get it when it makes
sense, not as a rush.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="b.-combat-weakness">B. Combat Weakness</h3>
<p>You have no combat bonuses, special combat abilities, or unit
advantages. In straight fights, you’re average at best. Your wealth
needs to translate into numerical superiority to win conflicts.</p>
<h3 id="c.-fine-dining-prices">C. Fine Dining Prices</h3>
<p>Your wealth is visible to everyone at the table. When people see your
stack of trade goods, they’ll charge you premium rates—higher prices for
promissory notes, more expensive deals, costly favors. You’re rich, so
everyone expects you to pay more. Budget accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="d.-production-capacity">D. Production Capacity</h3>
<p>Only 4 production in your home system. You need a forward space dock
or two to leverage your high fleet pool and big economy. Without
additional production capacity, your wealth can’t convert into ships
fast enough.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="v.-technology">V. Technology</h2>
<h3 id="a.-overview">A. Overview</h3>
<p>Hacan has two distinct tech paths available:</p>
<p><strong>Path 1 - Blue-Yellow (Mobility &amp; Carriers):</strong> The
default, reliable path. Focuses on mobility and unit upgrades using your
starting Antimass Deflectors and Sarween Tools. Pushes toward Gravity
Drive (B), Carrier II (BB), and Fleet Logistics (BB) for early
aggression, custodian grab, and objective scoring. Faster to get started
and not hero reliant—provides consistent performance throughout the
game.</p>
<p><strong>Path 2 - Red-Yellow (War Sun + Hero):</strong> The high-risk,
high-reward path. Requires getting Auto-Factories breakthrough
(R&lt;&gt;Y synergy) early in R1/R2. Uses the R&lt;&gt;Y synergy to rush
Magen Defense Grid (RR), Transit Diodes (YYY), Quantum Datahub Node
(YYYY), and War Sun (RRRY) by Round 4. Maximizes your hero’s ~15-35
resource production value but is slower to get online and heavily
dependent on getting breakthrough early and timing your hero
correctly.</p>
<p>Choose your path based on: breakthrough availability (R&lt;&gt;Y
required for Path 2), slice positioning (safe slice favors Path 2’s
slower buildup), and game tempo (Path 1 better for aggressive
tables).</p>
<h3 id="b.-starting-technologies">B. Starting Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Antimass Deflectors:</strong> Move through asteroid fields.
-1 to SPACE CANNON rolls against your units.</p>
<p><strong>Sarween Tools:</strong> Reduce the combined cost of produced
units by 1 when using PRODUCTION.</p>
<h3 id="c.-technology-paths">C. Technology Paths</h3>
<p><strong>Path 1 - Blue-Yellow (Mobility &amp; Carriers):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Round 1:</strong> Gravity Drive (B) - +1 movement for
custodian grab and positioning - <em>After you activate a system, apply
+1 to the move value of 1 of your ships during this tactical
action</em></p>
<p><strong>Round 2:</strong> Carrier II (BB) - Upgrade your 2 starting
carriers - <em>Move 2, Capacity 6 - helpful to fill out your slice and
reach objectives</em></p>
<p><strong>Round 3:</strong> Dreadnought II (BBY) - Strong combat ships
- <em>Move 2, Sustain Damage, BOMBARDMENT 5. Cannot be destroyed by
Direct Hit</em></p>
<p><strong>Round 4:</strong> Fleet Logistics (BB) - Double activation
for scoring and surprise plays - <em>During each of your turns of the
action phase, you may perform 2 actions instead of 1</em></p>
<p><strong>Round 5+:</strong> Light/Wave Deflector (BBB) or flex techs -
<em>Your ships can move through systems that contain other players’
ships</em></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Faster to get started and not hero reliant.
Strong general path for consistent performance.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Path 2 - Red-Yellow (War Sun + Hero):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prerequisite:</strong> Get Auto-Factories breakthrough
(R&lt;&gt;Y synergy) in R1/R2</p>
<p><strong>Round 1:</strong> Magen Defense Grid (RR) - With R&lt;&gt;Y,
counts as both red and yellow prereqs - <em>At the start of ground
combat on a planet with your structures, produce 1 hit assigned to
opponent’s ground forces</em></p>
<p><strong>Round 2:</strong> Transit Diodes (YYY) - Troop movement
flexibility - <em>Exhaust at start of your turn to remove up to 4 ground
forces and place them on planets you control</em></p>
<p><strong>Round 3:</strong> Quantum Datahub Node (YYY) - Strategy card
swaps - <em>Spend 1 strategy token + 3 TG to swap strategy cards with
another player</em></p>
<p><strong>Round 4:</strong> War Sun (RRRY) - For maximum hero value
~15-35 resources - <em>Cost 12, Combat 3(x3), Move 2, Capacity 6,
Sustain Damage, BOMBARDMENT 3(x3). Other players’ units in this system
lose Planetary Shield</em></p>
<p><strong>Round 5+:</strong> Gravity Drive (B) or other flex techs</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Requires getting breakthrough early. High
payoff with hero, but slower to get online than Path 1.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vi.-strategy-cards">VI. Strategy Cards</h2>
<h3 id="a.-round-1">A. Round 1</h3>
<p>Your R1 priority is getting started on your tech path early while
establishing your economy.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1 Priority Ranking:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Technology</strong> - Start your tech path immediately.
You need to get online early. Can greed for double tech potentially—bit
risky but high reward.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trade</strong> - Bonus 8 TGs, combined with agent and
your own 6 commodities, gives incredible flexibility. Economic
foundation for the game.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leadership</strong> - Command tokens to do all the
secondaries. Essential for expansion and production.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Politics</strong> - Speaker priority good for next round
(opens up custodian). Agenda control valuable once commander
unlocks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Construction</strong> - Forward space docks for
production capacity. You need more than your home system’s 4
production.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Warfare</strong> - Bad planets to refresh with your home
system, but warfare does allow for full slice filling with the extra
tactical action.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Just not worth it with your low
value planets in Round 1.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Imperial</strong> - Points come later. Focus on setup
first.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="b.-round-2">B. Round 2+</h3>
<p><strong>Love:</strong> - <strong>Technology</strong> - Tons of good
tech available. Can afford to double tech a few times with your wealth.
- <strong>Leadership</strong> - Stall potential with superb token
economy. Essential for flexible play.</p>
<p><strong>Like:</strong> - <strong>Trade</strong> - You get commodities
anyway with Masters of Trade secondary. Still good economic value. -
<strong>Construction</strong> - Production capacity until all 3 space
docks built. Essential for leveraging your economy. -
<strong>Imperial</strong> - Score objectives. Start pushing for points.
- <strong>Politics</strong> - Speaker priority and agenda control.
Valuable once commander unlocks.</p>
<p><strong>Situational:</strong> - <strong>Warfare</strong> - Fleet
token return useful for specific aggressive plays. -
<strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Rarely good. Only if you need a key system
defended.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vii.-intermediate">VII. Intermediate</h2>
<h3 id="a.-unit-composition">A. Unit Composition</h3>
<p><strong>Blue-Yellow Path:</strong></p>
<p>Your ideal fleet composition in each system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carrier II (upgraded by R2)</strong> - Move 2, Capacity 6
for rapid expansion and objective scoring</li>
<li><strong>Dreadnought II (upgraded by R3)</strong> - Combat power,
BOMBARDMENT 5, sustain damage</li>
<li><strong>Fighter screen</strong> - Absorb hits and provide combat
dice</li>
<li><strong>Infantry</strong> - Ground forces for objectives and planet
control</li>
<li><strong>Mechs (situational)</strong> - Can trade planets with
structures for tactical advantages</li>
<li><strong>Flagship (with hero timing)</strong> - Expensive but can be
produced for free with hero turn</li>
</ul>
<p>Prioritize upgraded carriers for mobility and capacity. Dreadnought
II provides combat power. Your wealth allows you to build larger fleets
than your home system production suggests—leverage this with forward
space docks.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Red-Yellow Path:</strong></p>
<p>Your ideal fleet composition in each system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carriers</strong> - Core transport for capacity</li>
<li><strong>War Sun (R4)</strong> - Overwhelming combat power,
coordinate with hero timing</li>
<li><strong>Destroyers (upgrade to Destroyer II with
R&lt;&gt;Y)</strong> - Cheap combat ships, AFB screening</li>
<li><strong>Fighter screen</strong> - Absorb hits and provide combat
dice</li>
<li><strong>Infantry</strong> - Ground forces for objectives, highly
mobile with Transit Diodes (R3)</li>
<li><strong>Mechs (situational)</strong> - Can trade planets with
structures for tactical advantages</li>
<li><strong>Flagship (with hero timing)</strong> - Expensive but can be
produced for free with hero turn</li>
</ul>
<p>War Sun arrives R4. Hero turn produces War Sun + full fleet for free
(~15-35 resources of value). With R&lt;&gt;Y breakthrough, Destroyer II
(RR) can be upgraded for additional combat power. With red or yellow
tech skip, you can rush War Sun faster by skipping Magen/Transit
Diodes.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="c.-game-plan">C. Game Plan</h3>
<p>Your game plan is straightforward: score early, get custodian bonus
if possible, operate from a safe slice with a super economy, make tons
of trades, and leverage every opportunity to build insurmountable
wealth. Use that wealth to score objectives and build a bigger fleet
than anyone expects.</p>
<p><strong>Early Game:</strong> Score objectives while your economy
gives you an edge. Push toward custodian if positioning allows.
Establish forward space docks for production capacity beyond your weak
home system.</p>
<p><strong>Mid Game:</strong> Make trades constantly to keep commodities
flowing and wealth accumulating. Broker deals between other players to
extract value. Find ways to get bonus power by trading away your
money—buy what you need, support others in exchange for favors, turn
wealth into leverage. Your wealth becomes voting power when needed.</p>
<p><strong>Late Game:</strong> Your economy should be overwhelming.
Convert wealth into an unexpectedly large fleet. Use hero for a critical
production turn (War Sun + full fleet for free = ~15-35 resources). Use
Quantum Datahub Node to swap strategy cards for exactly what you need.
You rarely come from behind—you stay at the front and close out the game
with flexibility and QDN.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="viii.-objectives">VIII. Objectives</h2>
<h3 id="a.-objective-summary">A. Objective Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Hacan dominates all spending objectives
with unmatched trade good generation and economic flexibility. Your
massive commodity economy makes resource and influence spending trivial,
and you can easily afford tech objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Combat objectives require more
investment without natural military bonuses. Structure objectives need
deliberate building, though your economy makes this achievable if you
prioritize it.</p>

<h2 id="ix.-alliance-priority">IX. Alliance Priority</h2>
<p>Trading for other factions’ Alliance promissory notes (which give you
access to their Commanders) can significantly boost your strategy. Here
are the top alliances to prioritize:</p>
<p><strong>Top Tier:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Embers of Muaat (Magmus)</strong> - After you spend a
token from your strategy pool, gain 1 trade good. Incredible passive
income with your excellent token economy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Crimson Rebellion (Ahk Siever)</strong> - At the end of a
combat between any players, gain 1 commodity or convert 1 of your
commodities to a trade good. Constant passive income from table
aggression.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vuil’raith Cabal (That Which Molds Flesh)</strong> - When
you produce fighters or infantry, up to 2 of those units do not count
against your PRODUCTION limit. Helps overcome your weak home production
capacity.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Winnu (Rickar Rickani)</strong> - Apply +2 to combat
rolls in Mecatol Rex, your home system, and legendary planet systems.
Strong combat boost for key battles and defends your weak home
system.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deepwrought Scholarate (Aello)</strong> - When another
player researches tech, they may reduce cost by 1; if they do, gain 1
commodity or convert 1 commodity to trade good. Passive income all game
that compounds your wealth advantage.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Good:</strong></p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p><strong>Titans of Ul (Tungstantus)</strong> - When you use
PRODUCTION, gain 1 trade good. Solid passive income.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nomad (Navarch Feng)</strong> - Produce your flagship
without spending resources. Saves 8 resources, though not amazing with
your hero and flagship being nothing special.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Nekro Virus (Nekro Acidos)</strong> - After you gain a
technology, draw 1 action card. You tech frequently and can afford
it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Yin Brotherhood (Brother Omar)</strong> - This card
satisfies a green tech prerequisite. When you research a tech owned by
another player, return 1 infantry to ignore prerequisites. Tech path
flexibility for War Sun or Quantum Datahub rushes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Yssaril Tribes (So Ata)</strong> - After another player
activates a system that contains your units, you may look at that
player’s action cards, promissory notes, or secret objectives. Strong
deterrent - you don’t want to be attacked.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This section highlights action cards that synergize particularly well
with your faction’s strengths or mitigate your weaknesses, relics that
offer exceptional value for your faction’s strategy and abilities, and
agendas to pursue that benefit your position, and agendas to watch out
for that could hurt you.</p>

<p>Emirates of Hacan are the faction for players who love economic
optimization and diplomatic maneuvering. You’re not the flashiest
faction, but you have more resources than everyone else and use that
advantage to methodically achieve victory.</p>
<p>Your biggest strength is flexibility. With overwhelming wealth, you
can afford anything—fleets, technologies, votes, bribes. Every trade is
an investment, building relationships and establishing leverage. Your
economy turns into political power, military strength, and ultimately
victory points.</p>
<p>When you master Hacan, you feel like the puppet master of the galaxy.
Emirates of Hacan don’t conquer the galaxy—they buy it, one trade at a
time.</p>
