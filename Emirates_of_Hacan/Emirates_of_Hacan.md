# Emirates of Hacan Guide

---

## I. Introduction

The Emirates of Hacan are TI4's master merchants—a faction for players who understand that everything has a price, and you can afford to pay it. While other factions scrape together resources and ration their economies, you're building an empire on pure wealth. You're the galactic marketplace, the faction that turns every negotiation into profit and every deal into leverage.

This is a faction about putting coin above all else. Short-term gains, long-term investments, political favors—it all flows through you. Being a skilled merchant means understanding value: when to spend, when to save, and when to buy exactly what you need to win. You don't conquer the galaxy through military might or technological supremacy. You buy your way to victory, one trade at a time.

Watch opponents realize too late that they've been funding your empire all along. Convert overwhelming wealth into a fleet from nothing. Casually outbid everyone at the political table with trade goods to spare. You don't fight for resources—you negotiate for them, then use that wealth to secure victory.

**"A wealthy man can err with impunity."**

## II. Playstyle

Playing Hacan means operating as the galaxy's central bank. You're not just rich—you're the person everyone needs to trade with to fuel their own economies. Your wealth generation happens automatically and constantly, giving you resources other factions simply can't match. This economic surplus translates into everything: bigger fleets, stronger political influence, and the flexibility to pivot toward whatever objectives appear.

Your early game is about establishing dominance through trade. Lock in favorable agreements, spread your economic influence across the table, and start accumulating the wealth that defines your faction. You're producing units more efficiently than almost anyone else, so use that advantage to expand and secure your position.

As the game progresses, your wealth becomes political power. You'll reach a point where you can simply buy votes, dominating the agenda phase through pure economic might. Your trade influence lets you broker deals between other players, extracting value from negotiations you're not even part of. You're not the strongest military faction, but you can afford to build whatever fleet you need when you need it.

Your endgame is about converting overwhelming economic advantage into victory. You can produce an entire fleet for free in a single activation, swap strategy cards to get exactly what you need, and outspend everyone at the political table. Use your wealth to buy support, bribe opponents away from conflict, and secure the path to victory. Other factions fight for the throne—you purchase it.

## III. The Basics

### A. Home System & Commodities

**Home System:** 3 planets
- **Hercant:** 1 resource / 1 influence = 0.5 optimal resource + 0.5 optimal influence
- **Arretze:** 2 resources / 0 influence = 2 optimal resources
- **Kamdorn:** 0 resources / 1 influence = 1 optimal influence
- **Total: 3 resources / 2 influence (2.5 optimal resources / 1.5 optimal influence)**

**Commodities:** 6

**Notes:** Your home system is one of the worst in the game. Your highest single-planet production is only 2 resources (Arretze), giving you weak production capacity. With only 2 total influence, you can't reach the 3 influence threshold for a bonus command token. Three separate planets means you have no realistic defense possibility against invasions. This home system causes you more headaches than joy.

What makes this faction tick is your 6 commodities—the highest in the game. Your wealth comes from trade, not from your pathetic home system.

### B. Starting Fleet
- 2 Carriers (capacity 12 total)
- 1 Cruiser
- 2 Fighters
- 4 Infantry
- 1 Space Dock

**Notes:** Solid starting fleet—not very strong militarily, but good for expansion. Two carriers with strong transport capacity, combined with your flexible economy and strong tech start, means you can usually claim 3 systems on Round 1.

### C. Faction Abilities

**Masters of Trade:** You do not have to spend a command token to resolve the secondary ability of the "Trade" strategy card.

Very good ability that lowers the value of the Trade strategy card for everyone else—you always get the refresh without spending a token. Every round someone takes Trade, you refresh your 6 commodities for free while other factions must spend a command token (limiting their activations) or skip the refresh entirely. You never have to worry about spending that token.

**Guild Ships:** You can negotiate transactions with players who are not your neighbor.

Standard rules only allow trading with neighbors. You ignore this restriction entirely, allowing you to broker deals with anyone at the table. This makes you the galactic marketplace.

**Arbiters:** When you are negotiating a transaction, action cards can be exchanged as part of that transaction.

Commonly underutilized ability. Trading action cards requires knowing who wants what card at what time, which takes attention and table awareness. The downside is you spoil your cards when trying to sell them—revealing what's in your hand gives away tactical information. But if you spend the game actively trying to pawn off action cards (or buying them from others), you can make a lot of profit. Action cards have real value—you just need to find the right buyer at the right moment.

### D. Starting and Faction Technologies

**Starting Technologies:**

**Antimass Deflectors:** Your ships can move through asteroid fields. Apply -1 to SPACE CANNON rolls against your units.

**Sarween Tools:** When you use PRODUCTION, reduce the combined cost of produced units by 1.

Great starting techs. Antimass Deflectors is solid for slice considerations—gives flexible mobility through asteroid fields. Sarween Tools provides value on every activation with production, effectively giving you 1 free resource per build. Strong foundation for your economy.

**Faction Technologies:**

**Quantum Datahub Node (YYY):**
*At the end of the strategy phase, you may spend 1 token from your strategy pool and give another player 3 of your trade goods. If you do, give 1 of your strategy cards to that player and take 1 of his strategy cards.*

Tier 4 yellow tech—pricey, but what is cost to a wealthy man? Swap strategy cards with other players for 1 strategy token and 3 trade goods. Can you put a price on winning the game? The flexibility to take exactly the strategy card you need in a critical round can be the difference between victory and defeat.

**PRODUCTION Biomes (GG):**
*ACTION: Exhaust this card and spend 1 token from your strategy pool to gain 4 trade goods and choose 1 other player; that player gains 2 trade goods.*

Green tech with no synergy with your other tech paths. Not good enough to research—never go for this. If you get it for free from Entropic Scar, obviously it's a net positive. When you use it, negotiate the split: whoever gets the 2 trade goods can give you back 1 for a 5/1 split, or keep it 4/2 but owe you a favor. You're a merchant—always broker the best deal.

### E. Leaders

**Agent - Carth of the Golden Sands:** During the action phase, you may exhaust this card to gain 2 commodities or replenish another player's commodities.

Your agent generates 2 commodities on demand or refreshes another player's commodities. Always try to find the player with the highest commodity count (usually 4) and refresh them for a negotiated split. Offer a 3/1 deal: you get 3 trade goods back, they keep 1 as a goodie. You're turning your agent into 3 trade goods while giving them value—classic merchant tactics.

**Commander - Gila the Silvertongue:**
- **Unlock:** Have 10 trade goods
- **Ability:** When you cast votes, you may spend any number of trade goods; cast 2 additional votes for each trade good spent.

Commonly unlocked by offering to send the Trade card holder's debt through you—at that moment, combined with your own 6 commodities, you'll probably be above 10 trade goods. The conversion rate (1 TG for 2 votes) is usually a bit too pricey to spend freely, but on important agendas people have to vote extra to make sure you don't throw a couple of coins in to move the scales. Your commander turns wealth into political leverage—the threat alone changes how people vote.

**Hero - Harrugh Gefhara:**
- **Unlock:** Have 3 scored objectives
- **Galactic Securities Net:** When 1 or more of your units use PRODUCTION, you may reduce the cost of each of your units to 0 during this use of PRODUCTION. If you do, purge this card.

Your hero is incredible—between ~15-35 resources of value depending on your production capacity. That's a crazy amount of plastic for free. The problem is getting War Sun tech if you want to maximize the hero value, then getting it out early enough for the War Sun to actually do something. Worst case scenario? You still get an incredible defensive fleet for zero cost. Best case? You swing the entire game with overwhelming force in a single activation.

### F. Promissory Note

**Trade Convoys:** Place this card faceup in your play area. While this card is in your play area, you may negotiate transactions with players who are not your neighbor. If you activate a system that contains 1 or more of the Hacan player's units, return this card to the Hacan player.

Maybe sell? If people are very friendly at the table, maybe it doesn't matter. But this really reduces your position as the merchant station for all deals to flow through—you lose the ability to put your thumb on the scale. When you control who can trade with whom, you extract value from every negotiation. Give that up, and you're just another faction with trade goods.

### G. Alliance

**Alliance Ability:** *While the Hacan player's commander is unlocked:* When you cast votes, you may spend any number of trade goods; cast 2 additional votes for each trade good spent.

One of the worst alliances in the game. People are generally not rich enough to leverage this ability—most factions don't have enough trade goods sitting around to make spending them for votes worthwhile. Can be used to secure a critical agenda if the buyer has resources. Best strategy: sell it during the agenda phase on a specific important agenda when it has immediate value to someone.

### H. Mech

**Pride of Kenara:** Cost 2, Combat 6, Sustain Damage

This planet's planet card may be traded as part of a transaction. If you do, move all of your units from this planet to another planet you control.

Your mechs enable trading planet cards (normally not allowed). Structures also move when you trade the planet—you can move a space dock to a surprise location, then make a big production there immediately. Beyond the surprise tactical value, this lets you temporarily trade planets for massive value then reclaim them later, or genuinely trade territory as part of diplomatic agreements.

### I. Flagship

**Wrath of Kenara:** Cost 8, Combat 7 (x2), Move 1, Capacity 3, Sustain Damage

After you roll a die during a space combat in this system, you may spend 1 trade good to apply +1 to the result.

Too costly for the ability it provides. Sure, you can spend a trade good or two if it makes sense in a critical moment, but if you're relying on trade goods for a 0.1 increase per roll, that combat wasn't very good to begin with. Build this if you need flagship objectives or a sustain damage ship—not because the ability is worth 8 resources.

### J. Breakthrough

**Auto-Factories:** R<>Y (Red-Yellow synergy)

When you produce 3 or more non-fighter ships, place 1 command token from your reinforcements into your fleet pool.

Creates a lot of economic power—consistently getting you 1-2 fleet tokens per round. Combined with your wealth, you can afford to produce 3+ ships frequently.

**Advanced tricks:** You can produce 3+ ships and then delete one (like a destroyer) to convert 1 resource into a fleet token—useful when you need tokens more than ships.

Your breakthrough token appears before the fleet token check. If you have 2 fleet tokens, you can build 3 ships, trigger the breakthrough (now at 3 tokens), and end at 3/3—perfectly legal. Without breakthrough, you'd be over the fleet limit.

### K. Slice and Draft Considerations

**Speaker Priority:** Anything top 5

As long as you're not last pick, you're fine. What matters more is having a friendly neighbor for board positioning.

**Priorities:**
- **Isolated slice if possible** - You can trade with anyone regardless of distance, so isolation doesn't hurt your economy. No need to worry about a neighbor who can't reach you. Being isolated = safe.
- **Valuable systems nearby home** - Not in equidistant. You want strong systems you can claim without immediate competition.
- **High optimal total** - Try to get high optimal resources and influence. Trade goods help, but they can't do everything—having rich systems matters a lot. Your slice doesn't need balance (equal resources/influence), just high totals.
- **Path to Mecatol Rex** - Need a way to reach Mecatol for potential custodian grab. You're not holding it long-term—just grabbing the bonus point.

**Nice to Have:**
- Yellow or red tech skip (enables War Sun + hero play for maximum value)
- Trait symmetry for objectives
- Entropic Scar (you have plenty of tokens to spend for free faction tech)
- Good resource planet to put forward space dock (you need production capacity beyond home)

**Avoid:**
- Equidistant systems (especially high-value ones—those cause the most conflict)
- Ultra-low optimal slices (even with trade goods, you need production base)
- Highly aggressive neighbor positioning

---

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

### A. First Turn Priorities

As Emirates of Hacan, your first turn priorities:

1. **Scoring** - You need to get started early. Your economic engine is good all game, but it's best in the early rounds. You rarely come from behind—you stay at the front. Score territorial objectives while your economy gives you the edge.

2. **Technology** - Start your tech path early. You begin with excellent starting tech position (Sarween Tools + Antimass Deflectors). Push toward Gravity Drive (B) for custodian grab and early mobility, or get started on War Sun (RRRY) prereqs to maximize impact of your hero.

3. **Expansion + Production** - With 2 starting carriers and strong early economy, expand to claim 2-3 systems. Your wealth funds the expansion.

4. **Breakthrough** - Auto-Factories is solid but lower priority. Sometimes you can't leverage it Round 1 anyway—you're rich enough to do a pricier expedition Round 2 instead. Get it when it makes sense, not as a rush.

### B. Combat Weakness

You have no combat bonuses, special combat abilities, or unit advantages. In straight fights, you're average at best. Your wealth needs to translate into numerical superiority to win conflicts.

### C. Fine Dining Prices

Your wealth is visible to everyone at the table. When people see your stack of trade goods, they'll charge you premium rates—higher prices for promissory notes, more expensive deals, costly favors. You're rich, so everyone expects you to pay more. Budget accordingly.

### D. Production Capacity

Only 4 production in your home system. You need a forward space dock or two to leverage your high fleet pool and big economy. Without additional production capacity, your wealth can't convert into ships fast enough.

---

## V. Technology

### A. Overview

Hacan has two distinct tech paths available:

**Path 1 - Blue-Yellow (Mobility & Carriers):** The default, reliable path. Focuses on mobility and unit upgrades using your starting Antimass Deflectors and Sarween Tools. Pushes toward Gravity Drive (B), Carrier II (BB), and Fleet Logistics (BB) for early aggression, custodian grab, and objective scoring. Faster to get started and not hero reliant—provides consistent performance throughout the game.

**Path 2 - Red-Yellow (War Sun + Hero):** The high-risk, high-reward path. Requires getting Auto-Factories breakthrough (R<>Y synergy) early in R1/R2. Uses the R<>Y synergy to rush Magen Defense Grid (RR), Transit Diodes (YYY), Quantum Datahub Node (YYYY), and War Sun (RRRY) by Round 4. Maximizes your hero's ~15-35 resource production value but is slower to get online and heavily dependent on getting breakthrough early and timing your hero correctly.

Choose your path based on: breakthrough availability (R<>Y required for Path 2), slice positioning (safe slice favors Path 2's slower buildup), and game tempo (Path 1 better for aggressive tables).

### B. Starting Technologies

**Antimass Deflectors:** Move through asteroid fields. -1 to SPACE CANNON rolls against your units.

**Sarween Tools:** Reduce the combined cost of produced units by 1 when using PRODUCTION.

### C. Technology Paths

**Path 1 - Blue-Yellow (Mobility & Carriers):**

**Round 1:** Gravity Drive (B) - +1 movement for custodian grab and positioning
- *After you activate a system, apply +1 to the move value of 1 of your ships during this tactical action*

**Round 2:** Carrier II (BB) - Upgrade your 2 starting carriers
- *Move 2, Capacity 6 - helpful to fill out your slice and reach objectives*

**Round 3:** Dreadnought II (BBY) - Strong combat ships
- *Move 2, Sustain Damage, BOMBARDMENT 5. Cannot be destroyed by Direct Hit*

**Round 4:** Fleet Logistics (BB) - Double activation for scoring and surprise plays
- *During each of your turns of the action phase, you may perform 2 actions instead of 1*

**Round 5+:** Light/Wave Deflector (BBB) or flex techs
- *Your ships can move through systems that contain other players' ships*

**Note:** Faster to get started and not hero reliant. Strong general path for consistent performance.

---

**Path 2 - Red-Yellow (War Sun + Hero):**

**Prerequisite:** Get Auto-Factories breakthrough (R<>Y synergy) in R1/R2

**Round 1:** Magen Defense Grid (RR) - With R<>Y, counts as both red and yellow prereqs
- *At the start of ground combat on a planet with your structures, produce 1 hit assigned to opponent's ground forces*

**Round 2:** Transit Diodes (YYY) - Troop movement flexibility
- *Exhaust at start of your turn to remove up to 4 ground forces and place them on planets you control*

**Round 3:** Quantum Datahub Node (YYY) - Strategy card swaps
- *Spend 1 strategy token + 3 TG to swap strategy cards with another player*

**Round 4:** War Sun (RRRY) - For maximum hero value ~15-35 resources
- *Cost 12, Combat 3(x3), Move 2, Capacity 6, Sustain Damage, BOMBARDMENT 3(x3). Other players' units in this system lose Planetary Shield*

**Round 5+:** Gravity Drive (B) or other flex techs

**Note:** Requires getting breakthrough early. High payoff with hero, but slower to get online than Path 1.

---

## VI. Strategy Cards

### A. Round 1

Your R1 priority is getting started on your tech path early while establishing your economy.

**Round 1 Priority Ranking:**

1. **Technology** - Start your tech path immediately. You need to get online early. Can greed for double tech potentially—bit risky but high reward.

2. **Trade** - Bonus 8 TGs, combined with agent and your own 6 commodities, gives incredible flexibility. Economic foundation for the game.

3. **Leadership** - Command tokens to do all the secondaries. Essential for expansion and production.

4. **Politics** - Speaker priority good for next round (opens up custodian). Agenda control valuable once commander unlocks.

5. **Construction** - Forward space docks for production capacity. You need more than your home system's 4 production.

6. **Warfare** - Bad planets to refresh with your home system, but warfare does allow for full slice filling with the extra tactical action.

7. **Diplomacy** - Just not worth it with your low value planets in Round 1.

8. **Imperial** - Points come later. Focus on setup first.

### B. Round 2+

**Love:**
- **Technology** - Tons of good tech available. Can afford to double tech a few times with your wealth.
- **Leadership** - Stall potential with superb token economy. Essential for flexible play.

**Like:**
- **Trade** - You get commodities anyway with Masters of Trade secondary. Still good economic value.
- **Construction** - Production capacity until all 3 space docks built. Essential for leveraging your economy.
- **Imperial** - Score objectives. Start pushing for points.
- **Politics** - Speaker priority and agenda control. Valuable once commander unlocks.

**Situational:**
- **Warfare** - Fleet token return useful for specific aggressive plays.
- **Diplomacy** - Rarely good. Only if you need a key system defended.

---

## VII. Intermediate

### A. Unit Composition

**Blue-Yellow Path:**

Your ideal fleet composition in each system:

- **Carrier II (upgraded by R2)** - Move 2, Capacity 6 for rapid expansion and objective scoring
- **Dreadnought II (upgraded by R3)** - Combat power, BOMBARDMENT 5, sustain damage
- **Fighter screen** - Absorb hits and provide combat dice
- **Infantry** - Ground forces for objectives and planet control
- **Mechs (situational)** - Can trade planets with structures for tactical advantages
- **Flagship (with hero timing)** - Expensive but can be produced for free with hero turn

Prioritize upgraded carriers for mobility and capacity. Dreadnought II provides combat power. Your wealth allows you to build larger fleets than your home system production suggests—leverage this with forward space docks.

---

**Red-Yellow Path:**

Your ideal fleet composition in each system:

- **Carriers** - Core transport for capacity
- **War Sun (R4)** - Overwhelming combat power, coordinate with hero timing
- **Destroyers (upgrade to Destroyer II with R<>Y)** - Cheap combat ships, AFB screening
- **Fighter screen** - Absorb hits and provide combat dice
- **Infantry** - Ground forces for objectives, highly mobile with Transit Diodes (R3)
- **Mechs (situational)** - Can trade planets with structures for tactical advantages
- **Flagship (with hero timing)** - Expensive but can be produced for free with hero turn

War Sun arrives R4. Hero turn produces War Sun + full fleet for free (~15-35 resources of value). With R<>Y breakthrough, Destroyer II (RR) can be upgraded for additional combat power. With red or yellow tech skip, you can rush War Sun faster by skipping Magen/Transit Diodes.

---

### C. Game Plan

Your game plan is straightforward: score early, get custodian bonus if possible, operate from a safe slice with a super economy, make tons of trades, and leverage every opportunity to build insurmountable wealth. Use that wealth to score objectives and build a bigger fleet than anyone expects.

**Early Game:** Score objectives while your economy gives you an edge. Push toward custodian if positioning allows. Establish forward space docks for production capacity beyond your weak home system.

**Mid Game:** Make trades constantly to keep commodities flowing and wealth accumulating. Broker deals between other players to extract value. Find ways to get bonus power by trading away your money—buy what you need, support others in exchange for favors, turn wealth into leverage. Your wealth becomes voting power when needed.

**Late Game:** Your economy should be overwhelming. Convert wealth into an unexpectedly large fleet. Use hero for a critical production turn (War Sun + full fleet for free = ~15-35 resources). Use Quantum Datahub Node to swap strategy cards for exactly what you need. You rarely come from behind—you stay at the front and close out the game with flexibility and QDN.

---

## VIII. Objectives

### A. Objective Summary

**Strengths:** Hacan dominates all spending objectives with unmatched trade good generation and economic flexibility. Your massive commodity economy makes resource and influence spending trivial, and you can easily afford tech objectives.

**Weaknesses:** Combat objectives require more investment without natural military bonuses. Structure objectives need deliberate building, though your economy makes this achievable if you prioritize it.

## IX. Alliance Priority

Trading for other factions' Alliance promissory notes (which give you access to their Commanders) can significantly boost your strategy. Here are the top alliances to prioritize:

**Top Tier:**

1. **Embers of Muaat (Magmus)** - After you spend a token from your strategy pool, gain 1 trade good. Incredible passive income with your excellent token economy.

2. **Crimson Rebellion (Ahk Siever)** - At the end of a combat between any players, gain 1 commodity or convert 1 of your commodities to a trade good. Constant passive income from table aggression.

3. **Vuil'raith Cabal (That Which Molds Flesh)** - When you produce fighters or infantry, up to 2 of those units do not count against your PRODUCTION limit. Helps overcome your weak home production capacity.

4. **Winnu (Rickar Rickani)** - Apply +2 to combat rolls in Mecatol Rex, your home system, and legendary planet systems. Strong combat boost for key battles and defends your weak home system.

5. **Deepwrought Scholarate (Aello)** - When another player researches tech, they may reduce cost by 1; if they do, gain 1 commodity or convert 1 commodity to trade good. Passive income all game that compounds your wealth advantage.

**Good:**

6. **Titans of Ul (Tungstantus)** - When you use PRODUCTION, gain 1 trade good. Solid passive income.

7. **Nomad (Navarch Feng)** - Produce your flagship without spending resources. Saves 8 resources, though not amazing with your hero and flagship being nothing special.

8. **Nekro Virus (Nekro Acidos)** - After you gain a technology, draw 1 action card. You tech frequently and can afford it.

9. **Yin Brotherhood (Brother Omar)** - This card satisfies a green tech prerequisite. When you research a tech owned by another player, return 1 infantry to ignore prerequisites. Tech path flexibility for War Sun or Quantum Datahub rushes.

10. **Yssaril Tribes (So Ata)** - After another player activates a system that contains your units, you may look at that player's action cards, promissory notes, or secret objectives. Strong deterrent - you don't want to be attacked.

## XI. End Notes

Emirates of Hacan are the faction for players who love economic optimization and diplomatic maneuvering. You're not the flashiest faction, but you have more resources than everyone else and use that advantage to methodically achieve victory.

Your biggest strength is flexibility. With overwhelming wealth, you can afford anything—fleets, technologies, votes, bribes. Every trade is an investment, building relationships and establishing leverage. Your economy turns into political power, military strength, and ultimately victory points.

When you master Hacan, you feel like the puppet master of the galaxy. Emirates of Hacan don't conquer the galaxy—they buy it, one trade at a time.

**"Everyone has a price, the important thing is to find out what it is."**
