# Emirates of Hacan Guide

*Art credit: Fantasy Flight Games*

## I. Introduction

The Emirates of Hacan are TI4's undisputed economic powerhouses and master diplomats. While other factions struggle to generate trade goods, build fleets, and maintain economies, you're drowning in resources from the most lucrative trade network in the galaxy. With 6 commodities (the highest in the game), the ability to trade with anyone regardless of distance, and the power to trade action cards, you're the faction that turns diplomacy into currency and currency into victory.

Your defining trait is Masters of Trade, which lets you refresh commodities via the Trade secondary without spending a command token. This seemingly small advantage compounds into massive economic value over the course of a game. Combined with Guild Ships (trade with non-neighbors) and Arbiters (trade action cards), you have diplomatic tools no other faction can match.

The Emirates of Hacan excel at economic dominance, political manipulation through trade good votes, and diplomatic leverage. You start with both Sarween Tools and Antimass Deflectors, giving you immediate economic efficiency and movement flexibility. Your faction technologies generate even more trade goods, your commander lets you buy votes with trade goods, and your hero enables a production turn with zero-cost units. You don't fight for resources - you negotiate for them, then buy whatever you need.

## II. Playstyle

The Hacan philosophy is simple: wealth is power, and power is victory. You want to maximize your economic output through trade, convert that wealth into fleet strength and political influence, and use your diplomatic position to navigate toward objectives while others exhaust themselves in conflict.

Early game Hacan focuses on establishing your trade network. Take the Trade strategy card in round 1 if possible, refresh all 6 commodities, and trade them away for maximum value. Your starting techs (Sarween Tools + Antimass Deflectors) give you immediate economic efficiency, so you're producing ships cheaper than almost anyone from round 1.

Mid-game transitions into economic dominance and political power. Your commander should unlock by round 3-4 (requires 10 trade goods), converting your wealth into voting power. Use your massive commodity count and trade influence to broker deals, secure borders, and position for objectives. You're not the strongest militarily, but you can afford to build large fleets with your economic surplus.

Late game Hacan is about converting economic advantage into victory points. Your hero allows one production phase where all units cost 0 resources - this can swing games by allowing you to produce a massive fleet for free. Your Quantum Datahub Node lets you swap strategy cards with other players, creating incredible flexibility. Use your wealth to buy support for the throne, bribe opponents away from attacking you, and secure the political outcomes you need.

## III. The Basics

### A. Home System & Commodities

**Home System:** 3 planets
- **Hercant:** 1 resource / 1 influence
- **Arretze:** 2 resources / 0 influence
- **Kamdorn:** 0 resources / 1 influence
- **Total: 3 resources / 2 influence (1 optimal resource / 1 optimal influence)**

**Commodities:** 6

Your home system is modest in total resources (3) but provides 3 planets, which is valuable for objectives requiring planet counts. The real power is your 6 commodities - more than any other faction in the game.

### B. Starting Fleet
- 2 Carriers (capacity 12 total)
- 1 Cruiser
- 2 Fighters
- 4 Infantry
- 1 Space Dock

Two starting carriers is unusual and gives you excellent transport capacity for early expansion. You're ready to claim 2-3 systems immediately.

### C. Starting Tech

**Antimass Deflectors (Blue):** Ships gain +1 movement when moving through or out of asteroid fields or supernovas.

**Sarween Tools (Yellow):** When you use PRODUCTION, you may spend 1 resource to gain 1 trade good, or spend 1 influence to gain 1 trade good.

This is one of the best starting tech combinations in the game. Sarween Tools provides immediate economic efficiency, and Antimass Deflectors gives movement flexibility.

### D. Faction Abilities

**Masters of Trade:** You do not have to spend a command token to resolve the secondary ability of the "Trade" strategy card.

This ability is quietly one of the strongest in the game. Every round someone takes Trade, you refresh your 6 commodities for free. Other factions must spend a command token (limiting their activations) or skip the refresh. You never have this limitation.

**Guild Ships:** You can negotiate transactions with players who are not your neighbor.

Standard rules only allow trading with neighbors. You ignore this restriction entirely, allowing you to broker deals with anyone at the table. This makes you the galactic marketplace.

**Arbiters:** When you are negotiating a transaction, action cards can be exchanged as part of that transaction.

Normally action cards cannot be traded. You break this rule, allowing you to buy/sell action cards for commodities, trade goods, promissory notes, or other considerations. This is incredible leverage.

### E. Leaders

**Agent - Carth of the Golden Sands:** During the action phase, you may exhaust this card to gain 2 commodities or replenish another player's commodities.

Your agent generates 2 commodities on demand or refreshes an ally's commodities. This creates diplomatic value (allies want commodity refreshes) and personal economic value.

**Commander - Gila the Silvertongue:**
- **Unlock:** Have 10 trade goods
- **Ability:** When you cast votes, you may spend any number of trade goods; cast 2 additional votes for each trade good spent.

This is absurd. With 10 trade goods, you can cast 20 additional votes, dominating any agenda. Your commander turns wealth directly into political power.

**Hero - Harrugh Gefhara:**
- **Unlock:** Have 3 scored objectives
- **Galactic Securities Net:** When 1 or more of your units use PRODUCTION, you may reduce the cost of each of your units to 0 during this use of PRODUCTION. If you do, purge this card.

Free production is game-warping. You can produce 10+ ships for 0 cost, creating a fleet from nothing. Time this correctly and you can swing from moderate fleet to overwhelming force in one activation.

### F. Promissory Note

**Trade Convoys:** Place this card faceup in your play area. While this card is in your play area, you may negotiate transactions with players who are not your neighbor. If you activate a system that contains 1 or more of the Hacan player's units, return this card to the Hacan player.

You give other players temporary Guild Ships ability. This is valuable for factions that struggle to reach trading partners, making your promissory note a premium diplomatic tool.

### G. Alliance

When resolving the primary or secondary ability of the Trade strategy card, your ally may resolve the primary or secondary ability as if they were you. When your ally replenishes commodities, they may replenish 2 additional commodities.

This is powerful for economic factions. Your ally effectively gains +2 commodities and can use Trade primary even if someone else took it.

### H. Mech

**Pride of Kenara:** Cost 2, Combat 6, Sustain Damage

This planet's planet card may be traded as part of a transaction. If you do, move all of your units from this planet to another planet you control.

Your mechs enable trading planet cards (normally not allowed). This can be used to temporarily trade planets for massive value, then reclaim them later, or to genuinely trade territory as part of diplomatic agreements.

### I. Flagship

**Wrath of Kenara:** Cost 8, Combat 7 (x2), Move 1, Capacity 3, Sustain Damage

After you roll a die during a space combat in this system, you may spend 1 trade good to apply +1 to the result.

Your flagship converts wealth into combat power. With sufficient trade goods, every combat roll can be boosted, making it exceptionally reliable in combat.

### J. Breakthrough

**Auto-Factories:** R<>Y (Red-Yellow synergy)

When you produce 3 or more non-fighter ships, place 1 command token from your reinforcements into your fleet pool.

This breakthrough generates fleet tokens when you produce large fleets. Combined with your economic power, you can afford to produce 3+ ships frequently, consistently generating the fleet tokens you need for expansion.

### K. Slice Considerations

**Must Have:**
- At least 3-4 high-value systems to trade into (you benefit from others having strong economies to trade with you)
- Access to Mecatol Rex (you can afford to hold it economically)
- Some influence planets (you need influence for politics despite your TG voting power)

**Nice to Have:**
- Yellow tech skips (supports Production Biomes faction tech)
- Industrial or hazardous planets (trait diversity for objectives)
- Wormholes or adjacent to multiple neighbors (more trade partners)

**Avoid:**
- Isolated slices with only 1-2 neighbors (limits trade opportunities)
- Ultra-low resource slices (even with trade, you need production capacity)
- Slices with aggressive military neighbors (you're not built for early conflict)

**Speaker Priority:** Medium-High (2-4th pick)

You want early Trade strategy card access, making mid-high speaker priority valuable.

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

**Combat Weakness:** You have no combat bonuses, special combat abilities, or unit advantages. In straight fights, you're average at best. Your wealth needs to translate into numerical superiority to win conflicts.

**Low Starting Resources:** 3 resources from your home system is below average. Your economy depends on trade networks, not home system production. If trade networks collapse, you struggle.

**Commander Unlock Threshold:** Requiring 10 trade goods seems easy for Hacan, but it's round 3-4 before you typically unlock. Before then, you can't convert wealth into votes.

**Dependency on Trade Card:** While Masters of Trade helps, your economy is still strongest when Trade strategy card is in play. If Trade doesn't get picked (unusual but possible), your commodity refresh is less efficient.

**Influence Poverty:** Only 2 influence from home system makes you influence-poor early. You rely on trade goods for voting, but before commander unlocks, you struggle in agenda phase.

**Target for Economic Disruption:** Everyone knows Hacan is wealthy. Expect opponents to try cutting trade networks, blocking expansion, or demanding favorable deals under threat of war.

## V. Technology

### A. Starting Technologies

**Antimass Deflectors (Blue):** +1 movement through/from asteroid fields and supernovas

**Sarween Tools (Yellow):** Convert 1 resource or influence to 1 trade good when using PRODUCTION

### B. Technology Paths

**Path 1 - Economic Maximization:**
1. Sarween Tools + Antimass Deflectors (starting)
2. Neural Motivator (Yellow-Yellow) - Command token efficiency
3. Production Biomes (Yellow-Yellow-Green-Green) - Faction tech generating TGs
4. Quantum Datahub Node (Yellow-Yellow-Yellow) - Faction tech for strategy card swaps
5. Sling Relay or other utility tech

This path doubles down on economic technologies, maximizing your trade good generation and diplomatic flexibility.

**Path 2 - Balanced Growth:**
1. Sarween Tools + Antimass Deflectors (starting)
2. Gravity Drive (Blue) - 2-movement mobility
3. Carrier II (Blue-Blue) - Improved carriers for expansion
4. Production Biomes (Green-Green) - Faction tech
5. Cruiser II or Dreadnought II

Balances economic tech with military capability.

**Path 3 - Combat Adaptation:**
1. Sarween Tools + Antimass Deflectors (starting)
2. Plasma Scoring (Red) - Combat boost
3. Dreadnought II (Blue-Blue-Red-Red) - Powerful capital ships
4. Duranium Armor (Red-Red) - Sustain Damage for non-fighter ships
5. Assault Cannon (Red-Red-Red) - Space Cannon offense

If combat objectives dominate or you face military pressure, pivot toward red tech.

### C. Key Technologies

**Must Get:**
- **Sarween Tools:** You start with this; never trade it away
- **Production Biomes:** Faction tech generating 4 TGs for you (2 for an ally)
- **Gravity Drive:** Mobility is always valuable

**High Priority:**
- **Quantum Datahub Node:** Faction tech for strategy card swaps
- **Carrier II:** Your 2 starting carriers benefit from upgrade
- **Fleet Logistics:** Double activation

**Solid Options:**
- **Neural Motivator:** Command token efficiency
- **Predictive Intelligence:** Action card draw (you can trade action cards!)
- **Light-Wave Deflector:** Expensive defensive tech if needed

## VI. Strategy Cards

### A. Round 1 Ratings

**Leadership (1):** **Good**. 3 command tokens are valuable, but you care more about Trade.

**Diplomacy (2):** **Bad**. You're not defensive; you're economic and diplomatic through deals, not card abilities.

**Politics (3):** **Like**. Speaker priority is valuable for getting Trade next round. Before commander, politics is harder.

**Construction (4):** **Good**. Extra space dock or PDS can be useful for expansion.

**Trade (5):** **Love**. This is your signature card. 6 commodities refreshed plus trade agreements is massive value.

**Warfare (6):** **Moderate**. Fleet token return is fine but not essential.

**Technology (7):** **Good**. You start with 2 techs but more is always good. Production Biomes requires yellow investment.

**Imperial (8):** **Great**. Points are the goal. You can hold Mecatol economically.

### B. General Strategy Card Priority

**Early Game (Rounds 1-2):**
Trade > Politics > Leadership > Technology

**Mid Game (Rounds 3-4):**
Trade > Imperial > Leadership > Politics

**Late Game (Rounds 5+):**
Imperial > Trade > Leadership > Politics

## VII. Intermediate

### A. Unit Composition

**Early Game (Rounds 1-3):**
- Core: 2-3 Carriers (including starting 2), 1-2 Cruisers, 0-1 Dreadnoughts
- Screen: 4-6 Fighters
- Ground: 8-10 Infantry, 0-1 Mechs
- Support: 1-2 Space Docks, 1 PDS

**Mid Game (Rounds 3-5):**
- Core: 3-4 Carriers, 2-3 Cruisers, 1-2 Dreadnoughts
- Screen: 8-12 Fighters
- Ground: 12-15 Infantry, 1-2 Mechs
- Support: 2 Space Docks, 2-3 PDS
- Special: Flagship if affordable

**Late Game (Rounds 5+):**
- Core: 4-5 Carriers, 3-4 Cruisers, 2-3 Dreadnoughts
- Screen: 12-16 Fighters
- Ground: 15-20 Infantry, 2-3 Mechs
- Support: 2-3 Space Docks, 3-4 PDS
- Special: Flagship active

**Notes:**
- Your wealth lets you build larger fleets than economic output suggests
- Carriers are your strength (2 starting); maintain carrier advantage
- Don't over-invest in expensive units early; use economic edge for numbers
- Hero allows free production - save it for critical moment

### B. Point Planning

**Christmas Land Scoring (10-point game):**

| Round | Public | Secret | MR | Bonus | Total | Cumulative |
|-------|--------|--------|-----|-------|-------|------------|
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| 3 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 4 |
| 5 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 6 |
| 6 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 2 | 8 |
| 7 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 10 |

**Notes:**
- Round 2: Score resource or trade good objective (you excel at these)
- Round 3: Commander unlocks, score secret involving spending resources/TGs
- Round 4: Continue public progression
- Round 5-6: Hold Mecatol with economic fleet sustain
- Round 7: Second secret for victory

### C. Game Plan

**Trade Network Establishment:**

Your primary game plan revolves around maximizing trade good generation through commodity refreshes and trade agreements.

**Round 1:** Take Trade strategy card if possible. If not, ensure you're positioned to use Trade secondary (free for you via Masters of Trade). Trade all 6 commodities to different players for maximum value - demand promissory notes, favorable trade good ratios, or political support.

**Round 2:** Use Masters of Trade to refresh 6 commodities for free. Trade again. By end of round 2, you should have accumulated 12+ trade goods plus whatever value you gained from trade agreements.

**Round 3-4:** Commander unlocks at 10 trade goods. Now you can spend trade goods for votes (2 votes per TG). Use this political power to secure favorable agenda outcomes. Continue trading 6 commodities per round.

**Round 5+:** Production Biomes (if researched) generates 4 trade goods per activation. Combined with commodity trading and Masters of Trade, you're generating 10+ trade goods per round. Use this overwhelming economic advantage to build fleets, buy votes, and broker deals.

**Quantum Datahub Node Strategy:**

Your faction tech lets you swap strategy cards with another player (costs 1 strategy token + 3 trade goods). This is incredibly powerful for:
1. Taking Imperial from an opponent in late rounds
2. Giving opponents problematic cards (Diplomacy to a military faction, etc.)
3. Securing Trade when someone else picked it
4. Gaining Leadership when you need command tokens

Time this ability for maximum political leverage.

**Hero Timing:**

Harrugh Gefhara allows one production phase where all units cost 0. The optimal time to use this:
- When you're behind in fleet supply and need to catch up instantly
- When a critical objective requires a large fleet
- Before a decisive combat where doubling your fleet wins the game
- When threatened by multiple opponents and need defensive forces

With Production 7-8 available, you can produce 7-8 units for free - that's 20-40 resources worth of value in one action.

**Action Card Trading:**

Your Arbiters ability lets you trade action cards. Use this to:
- Buy powerful action cards from opponents (Sabotage, Direct Hit, etc.)
- Sell weak action cards for trade goods or commodities
- Trade defensive cards to allies threatened by mutual enemies
- Collect promises not to use specific cards against you

## IX. Alliance Priority

**Best Alliance Partners:**

1. **Xxcha Kingdom:** Defensive faction benefits from your trade goods; mutual non-aggression works well

2. **Jol-Nar Universities:** Tech faction trades research for your commodities; synergistic pairing

3. **Winnu:** Weak economy benefits massively from your +2 commodity alliance ability

4. **Yssaril Tribes:** Political faction values your commander's voting power; manipulate agendas together

5. **Arborec:** Slow faction needs economic help; you provide trade while they provide military bulk

**Worst Alliance Partners:**

1. **Mentak Coalition:** Pirates steal your trade goods; directly conflicts with your economy

2. **L1Z1X Mindnet:** Pure military faction doesn't benefit much from trade; aggressive playstyle conflicts

3. **Sardakk N'orr:** Combat faction doesn't synergize with economic advantages

## X. End Notes

Emirates of Hacan are the faction for players who love economic optimization and diplomatic maneuvering. You're not the flashiest faction - no teleportation, no mechs that destroy fleets, no flagship with 12 combat dice. You're the faction that simply has more resources than everyone else and uses that advantage to methodically achieve victory.

The key to mastering Hacan is understanding that every commodity you trade is an investment. You're not just gaining trade goods - you're building relationships, creating dependencies, and establishing diplomatic leverage. When someone needs your 6 commodities to refresh their economy, they owe you. When you can trade action cards they desperately want, they'll pay premium. When your commander lets you spend 15 trade goods for 30 votes, you control the political landscape.

Your biggest strength is flexibility. With enough trade goods, you can afford anything - fleets, technologies, votes, bribes. While other factions are constrained by their home systems and production capacity, you're constrained only by what the table is willing to trade. And everyone always needs trade goods.

When you nail Hacan, you feel like the puppet master of the galaxy. Wars happen because you funded both sides. Agendas pass because you bought the votes. Objectives get scored because you could afford the fleet to hold Mecatol for three rounds straight. Your hero turn produces a fleet from nothing, swinging the game in an instant.

Emirates of Hacan don't conquer the galaxy - they buy it, one trade agreement at a time. And when the dust settles, you're sitting on Mecatol Rex with a fleet paid for by your opponents' own trade goods, having negotiated your way to 10 points while everyone else was fighting over scraps.
