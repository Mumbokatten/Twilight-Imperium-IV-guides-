<h1 id="twilight-imperium-iv---community-terminology-glossary">Twilight
Imperium IV - Community Terminology &amp; Glossary</h1>
<p>This guide explains community shorthand and terminology used
throughout the faction guides that doesn’t appear in the official
rulebook. If you’ve read the rules but find yourself confused by certain
terms in the guides, this reference is for you.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="shorthand-notation">Shorthand Notation</h2>
<h3 id="tech-prerequisites">Tech Prerequisites</h3>
<p>Technologies show prerequisite requirements using letter codes
representing colors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>B</strong> = Blue technology</li>
<li><strong>R</strong> = Red technology</li>
<li><strong>Y</strong> = Yellow technology</li>
<li><strong>G</strong> = Green technology</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Multiple Prerequisites:</strong> - <strong>BB</strong> = 2
Blue techs required (e.g., “Carrier II (BB)”) - <strong>RR</strong> = 2
Red techs required (e.g., “Duranium Armor (RR)”) - <strong>GG</strong> =
2 Green techs required (e.g., “Infantry II (GG)”) - <strong>YY</strong>
= 2 Yellow techs required (e.g., “Space Dock II (YY)”)</p>
<p><strong>Mixed Prerequisites:</strong> - <strong>GYR</strong> = 1
Green + 1 Yellow + 1 Red required (e.g., “Cruiser II (GYR)”) -
<strong>BBY</strong> = 2 Blue + 1 Yellow required (e.g., “Dreadnought II
(BBY)”) - <strong>RRRY</strong> = 3 Red + 1 Yellow required (e.g., “War
Sun (RRRY)”)</p>
<p><strong>Breakthrough Synergy Notation:</strong> -
<strong>B&lt;&gt;R</strong> = Blue and Red count as each other for
prerequisites - <strong>R&lt;&gt;Y</strong> = Red and Yellow count as
each other - <strong>Y&lt;&gt;G</strong> = Yellow and Green count as
each other</p>
<h3 id="round-abbreviations">Round Abbreviations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>R1</strong> = Round 1</li>
<li><strong>R2</strong> = Round 2</li>
<li><strong>R3-4</strong> = Rounds 3 through 4</li>
<li><strong>R5+</strong> = Round 5 and beyond</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples: “Research this tech R2-3” means “research this technology
during rounds 2 or 3.”</p>
<h3 id="common-abbreviations">Common Abbreviations</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>MR</strong> = Mecatol Rex (the central system)</li>
<li><strong>PN</strong> = Promissory Note</li>
<li><strong>TG</strong> = Trade Good(s)</li>
<li><strong>CC</strong> = Command Counter / Command Token</li>
<li><strong>HS</strong> = Home System</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="community-terminology">Community Terminology</h2>
<h3 id="slice">Slice</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Your section of the galaxy map - the 3-5
systems adjacent to your home system that form your starting
territory.</p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> “Rich slice” means good planets with high
resources/influence. “Balanced slice” means a mix of resources and
influence. “Your slice” refers to the systems you’re expected to claim
during initial expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> “Mahact wants resource-heavy slices” means
Mahact prefers systems with high resource values in their starting
territory.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="plastic">Plastic</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Community slang for units and ships on
the game board. Called “plastic” because the physical game pieces are
plastic miniatures.</p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> “Building plastic” = producing units. “More
plastic on the board” = having more ships and ground forces.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> “Getting your plastic economy started”
means beginning to produce units regularly.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="tech-skip">Tech Skip</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Community slang for a planet with a
technology specialty (the colored icons on some planet cards).</p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> When researching a technology, you may
exhaust a planet with a matching technology specialty to ignore one
prerequisite of that color.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> “You need blue tech skips for your tech
path” means you want planets with blue technology specialties to help
research blue technologies more easily.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong> A blue tech skip planet lets you
research a technology requiring 2 blue prerequisites with only 1 blue
tech owned. The specialty “skips” one prerequisite.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="equidistant">Equidistant</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Systems positioned between two or more
players’ home systems, equally accessible to multiple factions. Often
contested territory.</p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> These systems are typically high-value and
can be claimed by whichever player expands first. Not formally “owned”
by any player’s slice.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> “Grab an equidistant planet” means claiming
a valuable system between you and a neighbor before they do.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="tech-path">Tech Path</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Your planned sequence of technologies to
research, designed to efficiently reach your strategic goals.</p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> Paths are designed to unlock prerequisites
for key faction technologies or unit upgrades while minimizing wasted
research.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> “Blue tech path” = focusing on blue
technologies. “Your tech path is Grav Drive → Carrier II → Fleet
Logistics” means that’s your planned research order.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="forward-dock-forward-space-dock">Forward Dock / Forward Space
Dock</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A space dock built on a planet outside
your home system, providing production capacity closer to contested
areas or Mecatol Rex.</p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> Reduces movement needed for newly built units
to reach the front lines.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> “Build a forward dock on a high-resource
planet near Mecatol Rex” means placing a space dock outside your home
system for strategic production.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="double-tech">Double Tech</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Researching two technologies in a single
round.</p>
<p><strong>How:</strong> Normally accomplished by taking the Technology
strategy card (primary ability researches 1 tech, secondary ability lets
you spend resources for a 2nd tech). Some factions have abilities that
enable easier double-tech.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> “You can double tech R3 to get Carrier II
and Dreadnought II together.”</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="stalling">Stalling</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Taking non-committal actions to delay
your impactful moves, often waiting until other players have passed so
they cannot retaliate or stop your important plays.</p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> Players “stall” by taking low-value or
defensive actions to preserve their ability to make critical moves after
opponents have used up their actions and passed.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> “Use your strong token economy for stalling
in late game” means you can afford to take multiple small actions while
waiting for the right moment to make your big play when opponents can’t
respond.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="win-slaying">Win-Slaying</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The final-round aggressive moves needed
to secure victory points and prevent opponents from winning. The
critical end-game push.</p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> Typically refers to Round 5-6 plays like
taking Mecatol Rex, stealing key planets, or blocking the leader from
scoring objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> “Your hero is perfect for win-slaying”
means the hero ability is ideal for decisive end-game plays.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="optimal-resources-optimal-influence">Optimal Resources / Optimal
Influence</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> A calculation method for evaluating
planet value when planets have both resources and influence.</p>
<p><strong>How to Calculate:</strong> - A planet with <strong>2
resources / 0 influence</strong> = <strong>2 optimal resources, 0
optimal influence</strong> - A planet with <strong>1 resource / 1
influence</strong> = <strong>0.5 optimal resources, 0.5 optimal
influence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why:</strong> Since you can only use resources OR influence
from a planet at any given time (not both), planets with split values
have half the effective value in each category.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> “Your home system has 3 resources / 5
influence (0 optimal resources / 5 optimal influence)” means if you
always spend influence, you get the full 5 value. The 3 resources go
unused, so they don’t count as “optimal.”</p>
<p><strong>Usage in Guides:</strong> Helps evaluate the true economic
strength of mixed-value planets versus specialized planets.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="strategic-concepts">Strategic Concepts</h2>
<h3 id="component-action">Component Action</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> An action granted by a game component
such as an action card, technology, leader ability, or faction ability.
These are distinct from tactical actions (activating systems) and
strategic actions (using strategy cards).</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong> - Action cards with “ACTION:” written on
them (e.g., “ACTION: Spend 4 trade goods to research 1 technology”) -
Technologies with action abilities (e.g., Sling Relay: “ACTION: Exhaust
this card to produce 1 ship…”) - Agent abilities (usually “ACTION:
Exhaust this agent to…”) - Hero abilities (one-time component actions
that purge after use) - Faction abilities with “ACTION:” listed</p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> Component actions count as your action for
the turn during the action phase. Some faction abilities trigger “after
you perform a component action.”</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> “Council Keleres commander triggers after
component actions” means abilities like using your agent or playing an
action card will activate the commander ability.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="expansion">Expansion</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The early-game priority (Rounds 1-2) of
using your starting fleet to claim as many systems and planets as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Establish your economic base of resources and
influence for future production and strategy. Good expansion typically
means controlling 3-4 systems by end of Round 1.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="speaker-order">Speaker Order</h3>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> The turn order for selecting strategy
cards each round, determined by who holds the speaker token.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong> The speaker chooses first, followed by
players clockwise around the table. Being early in speaker order lets
you pick the best strategy cards; being late means choosing from
leftovers.</p>
<p><strong>Changes:</strong> The speaker token changes when someone
takes the Politics strategy card.</p>
<hr />
<p>This glossary covers the most common non-rulebook terminology you’ll
encounter in the faction guides. Understanding these terms will make the
strategic discussions much clearer.</p>
