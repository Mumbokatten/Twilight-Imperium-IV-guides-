# Sardakk N'orr Guide

![Sardakk N'orr](SardakkArt.webp)

---

## I. Introduction

The Sardakk N'orr are TI4's purest combat faction. This faction excels at winning fights through Unrelenting (+1 to all combat rolls), leveraging superior ground forces and dreadnoughts (Exotrireme with BOMBARDMENT 4 x2 + Capacity 1), and extracting value from every victory. Sardakk isn't about economic efficiency or technological supremacy—it's about military dominance, winning through superior combat math, and turning aggression into victory points.

The payoff? Watching opponents realize your infantry hit on 7 instead of 8 (+1 Unrelenting), seeing your Exotrireme dreadnoughts BOMBARD at 4 with 2 dice then land infantry via capacity 1, and using Valkyrie Particle Weave to generate extra hits whenever opponents hit you. When you've mastered combat math and leverage your +1 advantage perfectly, every battle becomes a favorable trade.

## II. Playstyle

Playing Sardakk N'orr is like being a relentless war machine. Your Unrelenting gives +1 to ALL combat rolls (space combat, ground combat, BOMBARDMENT, SPACE CANNON, AFB), your Exotrireme dreadnoughts have built-in capacity for invasions, and your breakthrough (N'orr Supremacy) lets you gain CCs or research unit upgrades after winning combats. You're not turtling or tech-racing—you're fighting constantly and converting victories into tangible advantages.

The key strength of Sardakk is combat superiority without tech investment. Your +1 Unrelenting makes all your units better than opponents' units at the same tech level. Infantry hit on 7 (vs 8), fighters hit on 8 (vs 9), dreadnoughts hit on 4 (vs 5). This scales—even with 0 technologies researched, you're competitive in combat.

Opponents will fear engaging you in combat once they realize your math advantage. That moment when your "basic" infantry consistently defeat their "upgraded" ground forces? Pure military dominance.

## III. The Basics

### A. Home System & Commodities

**Home System:**
- **Tren'Lak:** 1 resource / 0 influence = 1 optimal resource / 0 optimal influence
- **Quinarra:** 3 resources / 1 influence = 3 optimal resources / 1 optimal influence
- **Total: 4 resources / 1 influence (4 optimal resources / 1 optimal influence)**

**Commodities:** 3

**Notes:** Resource-heavy home system (4 resources, only 1 influence). Excellent for fleet production, terrible for voting. Two-planet home provides flexibility. Your 3 commodities are decent for trading. Built for military production, not politics.

### B. Starting Fleet

- 2 Carriers
- 1 Cruiser
- 5 Infantry
- 1 Space Dock
- 1 PDS

**Notes:** Infantry-heavy starting fleet. 5 starting infantry (most factions have 2-4) gives you immediate ground force superiority. 2 carriers provide capacity 8 total. Excellent for R1 expansion and early invasions.

### C. Starting Technologies

**None (0 starting technologies)**

**Notes:** You start with ZERO technologies. This is the weakest tech position in the game (tied with some other factions). You're behind everyone technologically BUT your Unrelenting (+1 combat) compensates—you don't need unit upgrades as urgently as other factions.

### D. Faction Abilities

**Unrelenting (Faction Ability):** Apply +1 to the result of each of your unit's combat rolls.

Your signature ability and faction identity. ALL your units get +1 to combat rolls:
- Infantry: 8 → 7 to hit (from 30% to 50% hit rate = +66% effectiveness)
- Fighters: 9 → 8 to hit (from 20% to 30% hit rate = +50% effectiveness)
- Cruisers: 7 → 6 to hit (from 40% to 50% hit rate = +25% effectiveness)
- Dreadnoughts: 5 → 4 to hit (from 50% to 70% hit rate = +40% effectiveness)
- BOMBARDMENT: 5 → 4 to hit
- SPACE CANNON: 6 → 5 to hit (if you build PDS)

This is MASSIVE. You're effectively one tech tier ahead in combat without researching anything.

### E. Leaders

**Agent - T'ro:**

At the end of a player's tactical ACTION: You may exhaust this card; if you do, that player may place 2 infantry from their reinforcements on a planet they control in the active system.

Support agent. After any tactical action, exhaust to let that player (you or opponent) place 2 free infantry on planets in active system. Use on yourself (free reinforcements) or trade to others for favors.

**Commander - G'hom Sek'kus:** *Unlock: Control 5 planets in non-home systems.*

During the "Commit Ground Forces" step: You can commit up to 1 ground force from each planet in the active system and each planet in adjacent systems that do not contain 1 of your command tokens.

Powerful invasion commander. Easy unlock (5 non-home planets by R2-R3). Once unlocked, when invading, you can commit ground forces from:
1. Planets in the active system (normal)
2. Planets in ADJACENT systems (not normal!)

This lets you invade with massive armies by pulling infantry from neighboring planets. If invading a system adjacent to 3 of your planets, you can commit ground forces from all 3 for overwhelming numbers.

**Hero - Sh'val, Harbinger:** *Unlock: Have 3 scored objectives.* **Tekklar Conditioning** - After you move ships into the active system: You may skip directly to the "Commit Ground Forces" step. If you do, after you commit ground forces to land on planets, purge this card and return each of your ships in the active system to your reinforcements.

Devastating invasion hero. Move ships into system, skip directly to invasion (no space combat), land ground forces, then your ships disappear. Use this to:
1. Bypass enemy fleets entirely (no space combat)
2. Invade multiple planets with ground forces
3. Sacrifice ships (they return to reinforcements, not destroyed)

Example: Move 3 carriers with 12 infantry into enemy system. Hero: Skip space combat, land 12 infantry on 3 planets, ships disappear. You just invaded 3 planets without fighting their fleet.

### F. Promissory Note - **Tekklar Legion**

At the start of an invasion combat: Apply +1 to the result of each of your unit's combat rolls during this combat. If your opponent is the Sardakk N'orr player, apply -1 to the result of his unit's combat rolls during this combat. Then, return this card to the N'orr player.

Powerful invasion promissory. Holder gets +1 to combat rolls in ONE ground combat. If fighting YOU (Sardakk), you get -1 (net -2 swing). Trade value: 3-4 TG or Alliance. Excellent for aggressive factions (Cabal, Nekro) who invade frequently.

### G. Alliance

When you produce ships, you may produce 1 additional fighter or infantry for its cost.

Standard production bonus. Useful for economic factions. Trade value: 3-4 TG or equivalent.

### H. Mech - **Valkyrie Exoskeleton**

Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | **Sustain Damage**

After this unit uses its Sustain Damage ability during ground combat, it produces 1 hit against your opponent's ground forces on this planet.

Excellent mech. When it sustains damage (blocks 1 hit), it produces 1 hit back. This makes it incredibly durable in ground combat—enemies must hit it twice AND take damage when they hit it the first time. With Unrelenting (+1), it hits on 5 instead of 6.

### I. Flagship - **C'Morran N'orr**

Cost: 8 | Combat: 6 (x2) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 3 | **Sustain Damage**

Apply +1 to the result of each of your other ship's combat rolls in this system.

Stacking combat bonus flagship. Your flagship gives +1 to ALL other ships in the system. Combined with Unrelenting (+1), your ships get +2 total:
- Fighters: 9 → 7 to hit (70% hit rate!)
- Cruisers: 7 → 5 to hit (80% hit rate!)
- Dreadnoughts: 5 → 3 to hit (100% hit rate!!!)

This makes your fleet ABSURDLY powerful. Your flagship essentially gives all ships a tier-2 upgrade for free.

### J. Exotrireme I - **N'orr Dreadnought (Special Unit)**

Cost: 4 | Combat: 5 | Move: 1 | **Capacity: 1** | **BOMBARDMENT 4 (x2)** | **Sustain Damage**

Your unique dreadnought. Key features:
- **Capacity 1:** Can transport 1 infantry (normal dreadnoughts have 0 capacity). Excellent for invasions.
- **BOMBARDMENT 4 (x2):** Rolls 2 dice at 4 to hit (with Unrelenting). 70% hit rate per die = 1.4 expected hits.
- **Combat 5:** With Unrelenting, hits on 4 (70% hit rate).

This dreadnought is perfect for Sardakk's aggressive playstyle—BOMBARD planets, land infantry via capacity, invade.

### K. Breakthrough - **N'orr Supremacy (B<>R)**

After you win a combat, either gain 1 command token or research a unit upgrade technology.

**B<>R Synergy:** Blue and red technologies count as each other for prerequisites.

**Combat Reward:** After EACH combat victory, choose:
1. Gain 1 CC (any pool)
2. Research 1 unit upgrade tech

This is incredible. Win 5 combats R2-R4 = gain 5 CCs OR research 5 unit upgrades. You convert aggression into tangible economic/tech advantages.

**B<>R synergy:** Opens flexible tech paths (blue/red interchangeable).

**Strategic Value:** Enables aggressive tech-poor starts—fight constantly, research unit upgrades from combat victories instead of Technology strategy card.

### L. Slice and Draft Considerations

Sardakk wants aggressive positioning and resources:

**Speaker Order:**
- **Prefer positions 2-4** - Lets you grab Warfare or Leadership early.
- **Any position acceptable** - Flexible for aggression.

**Slice Priorities:**
- **Weak/tech-focused neighbors** - You dominate early combat. Target Jol-Nar, Xxcha, Winnu.
- **High resource planets** - Need resources for dreadnought/infantry production.
- **Tech skips (any helpful)** - You have 0 starting techs. ANY skip accelerates you.
- **Clustered opponents** - You want multiple neighbors to raid.

**Slice Features to Avoid:**
- **Combat-heavy neighbors (Nekro, Cabal, Yin)** - You're strong but fighting only combat factions is inefficient.
- **Resource-starved slices** - Can't build fleets without resources.
- **Isolated slices** - Need neighbors to attack for breakthrough rewards.

**Summary:**
Sardakk wants weak neighbors to raid, resources for production, and tech skips to accelerate. Your 0 starting techs mean you're behind technologically but ahead militarily. Embrace aggression.

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

### A. First Turn Priorities

Your R1 priority order: **Warfare > Leadership > Technology**

Focus on:
1. **Warfare** - Enables aggression and fleet redistribution.
2. **Leadership** - CCs for expansion and combat.
3. **Technology** - Begin tech path (you have 0 techs, desperately need to catch up).
4. **Trade** - Refresh 3 commodities for resources.

**Expansion Notes:** You have 2 carriers (capacity 8), 1 cruiser, and 5 infantry. Excellent R1 expansion capability. Aim for 3-4 systems R1, prioritizing weak neighbors or contested equidistant systems. Your 5 infantry give you ground force superiority R1.

### B. Technology Deficit

0 starting technologies means you're behind everyone R1. You need to research aggressively R2-R4 OR rely on N'orr Supremacy (win combats to research unit upgrades).

**Mitigation:** Use breakthrough to research unit upgrades from combat wins. Fight 3-5 times R2-R4, research 3-5 unit upgrades without taking Technology. Alternatively, take Technology R2-R3 to catch up.

### C. Political Weakness

Only 1 influence at home makes you terrible at voting and political objectives. Expand to influence planets quickly.

**Mitigation:** Expand to cultural planets R1-R2. Use military strength to intimidate political opponents. Focus on combat objectives, not political ones.

### D. Over-Aggression Risk

Sardakk players often over-commit to combat, exhausting their fleets and leaving themselves vulnerable to counterattacks. You're strong in combat but not immortal.

**Mitigation:** Fight selectively. Target weak opponents or contested systems. Don't burn all your fleet fighting a strong military faction—raid weak economic factions instead.

---

## V. Technology

### A. Overview

You start with **0 technologies.**

Your main tech path should leverage N'orr Supremacy (research unit upgrades from combat wins) or traditional tech paths focusing on unit upgrades and mobility.

### B. Tech Path 1: Combat Supremacy (Standard)

**Starting Techs:** None (0)

**Round 1: Sarween Tools (Y)**
- When you use PRODUCTION, reduce combined cost by 1
- **Why:** Economic efficiency. You'll produce constantly (dreadnoughts, infantry).
- **Prerequisites:** None (0)

**Round 2: Exotrireme II (BBY) - WITH N'ORR SUPREMACY**
- N'orr Dreadnought: Cost 4 | Combat 5 | Move 2 | Capacity 1 | BOMBARDMENT 4 (x2) | Sustain Damage | Cannot be destroyed by Direct Hit | After combat round, may destroy this to destroy up to 2 ships
- **Why:** Your faction tech. Upgraded dreadnoughts with move 2, Direct Hit immunity, and kamikaze ability (destroy self to kill 2 ships).
- **Prerequisites:** 2 blue + 1 yellow (Sarween + 2 blue techs OR win combat with N'orr Supremacy to bypass)
- **Via Breakthrough:** Win 1 combat, research Exotrireme II directly

**Round 3: Valkyrie Particle Weave (RR) - WITH N'ORR SUPREMACY**
- After making combat rolls in ground combat, if opponent produced hits, you produce 1 additional hit
- **Why:** Your other faction tech. Generates extra hits in ground combat when you're hit.
- **Prerequisites:** 2 red (need red techs OR win combat with N'orr Supremacy)
- **Via Breakthrough:** Win 1 combat, research Valkyrie Particle Weave directly

**Round 4: Gravity Drive (BB)**
- +1 move to 1 ship per activation
- **Why:** Mobility for raids and repositioning.

**Round 5+:** Carrier II, Fleet Logistics, other flex techs

**Tech Requirements:**
- **Combat victories (CRITICAL for breakthrough path):** Win 3-5 combats R2-R4 to research both faction techs + unit upgrades
- **Blue skip (helpful):** Accelerates Exotrireme II if not using breakthrough
- **Yellow skip (helpful):** Speeds Sarween
- **Red skip (helpful):** Accelerates Valkyrie Particle Weave

**Pros:**
- Uses N'orr Supremacy to research from combat wins (no Technology needed)
- Both faction techs by R3
- Aggressive tech progression
- Constant fighting = constant tech gains

**Cons:**
- Requires winning combats (risky if opponents avoid you)

**Best For:** Aggressive games with weak neighbors. Fight constantly, research from victories.

---

### C. Tech Path 2: Traditional (Alternative)

**Starting Techs:** None (0)

**Round 1: Sarween Tools (Y)**

**Round 2: Antimass Deflectors (B) OR Gravity Drive (BB) - WITH SKIP**
- Mobility and asteroid navigation

**Round 3: Carrier II (BBBB)**
- Transport armies for invasions

**Round 4: Exotrireme II (BBY)**
- Faction tech via traditional research

**Round 5+:** Valkyrie Particle Weave, Fleet Logistics

**Pros:**
- Traditional tech progression (less risky)
- Early mobility (Gravity Drive R2)

**Cons:**
- Delays faction techs to R4-R5
- Doesn't leverage N'orr Supremacy

**Best For:** Peaceful games where you can't fight enough for breakthrough.

---

## VI. Strategy Cards

### A. Round One

Your R1 priority is aggression and expansion.

**R1 Priority Ranking:**

1. **Warfare** - Combat enabler. Redistribution for raids.

2. **Leadership** - CCs for expansion and combat.

3. **Technology** - Catch up on tech deficit (0 starting techs).

4. **Trade** - Refresh 3 commodities for resources.

5. **Construction** - Build forward structures.

6. **Politics** - Less useful (1 influence home).

7. **Diplomacy** - Less useful (1 influence home).

8. **Imperial** - Never R1.

### B. Generally (R2+)

**Love:**
- **Warfare** - Combat enabler. You want to fight constantly.
- **Leadership** - CCs for aggression and production.
- **Technology** - Catch up on tech (if not using breakthrough exclusively).

**Good:**
- **Imperial** - Needed for scoring R3-R5.
- **Trade** - Refresh 3 commodities.

**Situational:**
- **Construction** - Only if needing structures.
- **Politics/Diplomacy** - Less useful (1 influence home).

---

## VII. Intermediate

### A. Unit Composition

Your ideal fleet leverages Unrelenting and Exotrireme:

**Preferred Units:**
- **Exotrireme Dreadnoughts** - Combat 5 (hits on 4 with Unrelenting = 70%), BOMBARDMENT 4 (x2), Capacity 1. Build 5-8 by R4.
- **Infantry** - Hit on 7 with Unrelenting (50% hit rate). Mass infantry (15-20 total).
- **Carriers** - Transport infantry for invasions.
- **Fighters (optional)** - Hit on 8 with Unrelenting. Fighter screens if needed.
- **Flagship (late game)** - Gives all ships +1 (stacks with Unrelenting for +2 total).

**Combat Strategy:**
R2-R3: Raid weak neighbors with dreadnoughts + infantry (BOMBARD then invade)
R4-R5: Massed dreadnought fleets with flagship (+2 combat to all ships)

### B. Point Planning

**Sardakk N'orr Christmas-Land Strategy Cards:**

| Round | Card             | Public Points | Secret Points | MR Points | Bonus | Total |
|-------|------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|-------|-------|
| One   | Warfare          | 0             | 0             | 0         | 0     | 0     |
| Two   | Leadership       | 1             | 0             | 0         | 0     | 1     |
| Three | Imperial         | 3             | 1             | 1         | 0     | 5     |
| Four  | Warfare          | 4             | 2             | 1         | 1     | 8     |
| Five  | Imperial         | 6             | 3             | 2         | 1     | 12    |

You can only score 1 public objective per round (2 if you have Imperial). When you take Imperial, you can double score publics. Aim to score all 3 secrets across the game.

**Notes:**
- Sardakk scores through combat objectives (constant fighting)
- Warfare R1/R4 for aggressive expansion
- Commander unlocks R2-R3 (5 non-home planets)
- N'orr Supremacy generates 5-8 tech gains R2-R5 from combat wins

### C. Game Plan

**Strategic Approach:**

**Rounds 1-2: Aggressive Expansion & First Combats**
- Take Warfare R1
- Expand to 4-5 systems, targeting weak neighbors
- Build 3-5 Exotrireme dreadnoughts
- Fight 2-3 combats R2 (win to trigger N'orr Supremacy)
- Research Exotrireme II and/or Valkyrie Particle Weave from combat wins
- Unlock Commander R2-R3 (5 non-home planets)

**Rounds 3-4: Raid & Supremacy Loop**
- Continue fighting (2-3 combats per round)
- Each win = gain 1 CC OR research 1 unit upgrade (N'orr Supremacy)
- Commander enables massive invasions (pull infantry from adjacent planets)
- Build up to 8 Exotrireme dreadnoughts + 15 infantry
- Target weak economic factions (Jol-Nar, Xxcha, Hacan)

**Round 5: Hero Invasion & Final Push**
- Hero R5: Bypass enemy fleets entirely, land ground forces, ships disappear
- Commander + Hero combo: Pull infantry from adjacent planets + bypass space combat = unstoppable invasions
- Score combat objectives (Spark a Rebellion, Darken the Skies, etc.)
- Win through military superiority

**Key Strategic Principles:**
1. **Fight constantly** - Every combat win = CC or unit upgrade via N'orr Supremacy
2. **Target weak factions** - Raid Jol-Nar, Xxcha, Winnu (avoid Nekro, Cabal)
3. **Exotrireme spam** - Build 8 dreadnoughts by R4 for BOMBARDMENT invasions
4. **Commander invasions** - Pull infantry from adjacent planets for overwhelming numbers
5. **Hero R5** - Bypass fleets, invade 3-4 planets simultaneously
6. **Flagship late game** - +1 to all ships (stacks with Unrelenting for +2 total)

## IX. Alliance Priority

**Super Top Tier:**
1. **Hacan (Carth of Golden Sands)** - Reroll combat dice. Stacks with +1 Unrelenting for massive hit rates.
2. **Titans of Ul (Tungstantus)** - Every production = 1 TG. You produce constantly.
3. **Jol-Nar (Ta Zern)** - Reroll PRODUCTION/AFB/BOMBARDMENT/SPACE CANNON. Boosts your Exotrireme BOMBARDMENT.
4. **Nomad (Navarch Feng)** - Produce flagship without resources. Saves 8 resources.

## X. End Notes

Sardakk N'orr is a top-tier combat faction with unmatched military strength. Your job is to:

1. **Fight constantly R2-R5** - Every combat win = CC or unit upgrade via N'orr Supremacy
2. **Target weak neighbors** - Raid Jol-Nar, Xxcha, Winnu (avoid combat-heavy factions)
3. **Build 8 Exotrireme dreadnoughts** - BOMBARDMENT 4 (x2) + Capacity 1 for invasions
4. **Unlock Commander R2-R3** - 5 non-home planets for adjacent-planet invasion pulls
5. **Research both faction techs via breakthrough** - Win combats, research Exotrireme II + Valkyrie Particle Weave
6. **Hero R5** - Bypass enemy fleets entirely for unstoppable invasions
7. **Flagship late game** - +1 to all ships (stacks with Unrelenting for +2 total = devastating)

Don't let anyone tell you 0 starting techs makes you weak. Your +1 Unrelenting compensates completely—you're one tech tier ahead in combat without researching anything. Fight aggressively, leverage N'orr Supremacy, and dominate through superior combat math.

**UNRELENTING. UNSTOPPABLE. VICTORIOUS.**
