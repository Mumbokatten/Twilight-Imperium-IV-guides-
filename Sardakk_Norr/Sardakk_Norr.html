<hr />
<h2 id="i.-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>The Sardakk N’orr are the galaxy’s premier mercenaries—a swarm of
relentless bug warriors who do the dirty work nobody else can. You’re
not building a peaceful empire or racing for technology. You’re
deploying massive armies of infantry across the map, taking out threats
by yourself, and getting paid in command tokens and tech for every fight
you win. Sardakk N’orr is about overwhelming opponents with superior
numbers and raw combat skill, then leveraging that violence into
success.</p>
<p>If you are scared to make an enemy or two, Sardakk is not for
you.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-playstyle">II. Playstyle</h2>
<p>Playing Sardakk N’orr means embracing your role as the table’s hired
gun—employed by yourself. You flood the board with cheap infantry and
fighters, strike at whoever’s in your way, and extract command tokens
and tech from constant aggression. Your units hit harder in combat than
anyone else’s, your armies can invade from neighboring systems without
ships, and every fight you win makes you stronger.</p>
<p>The beauty of Sardakk is that you don’t need fancy technology or a
booming economy. You just need unit upgrades, tokens and bodies…Lot’s of
bodies. Swarm planets with infantry, pressure your neighbors, and make
deals to take out the leaders. Someone’s ahead? You’re the one who can
stop them. Want to score objectives? Trade your military services for
support.</p>
<p>You’re behind in tech, behind in points, but scary as hell for
anything within reach.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iii.-the-basics">III. The Basics</h2>
<h3 id="a.-home-system-commodities">A. Home System &amp;
Commodities</h3>
<p><strong>Home System:</strong> - <strong>Tren’Lak:</strong> 1 resource
/ 0 influence - <strong>Quinarra:</strong> 3 resources / 1 influence -
<strong>Total: 4 resources / 1 influence (4 optimal resources / 0
optimal influence)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commodities:</strong> 3</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Resource-heavy home system (4 resources, only
1 influence). Excellent for fleet production, terrible for voting and
tokens. Two-planet home system is mediocre for defense. Your 3
commodities are decent for trading. Built for military production, not
politics.</p>
<h3 id="b.-starting-fleet">B. Starting Fleet</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 Carriers</li>
<li>1 Cruiser</li>
<li>5 Infantry</li>
<li>1 Space Dock</li>
<li>1 PDS</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Great starting fleet. 2 carriers with
capacity and 5 infantry allows for great expansion to best systems
nearby. Your mighty fleet of swarming fighters…oh wait, we didn’t get
any. Well, good enough.</p>
<h3 id="c.-faction-abilities">C. Faction Abilities</h3>
<p><strong>Unrelenting (Faction Ability):</strong> Apply +1 to the
result of each of your unit’s combat rolls.</p>
<p>Your signature ability. Only works during combat rounds—does NOT
apply to pre-combat abilities like ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE, SPACE CANNON,
or BOMBARDMENT.</p>
<p>Unrelenting gives each unit 0.1 expected extra hit. For every 10
units you roll, you get 1 extra hit on average. Not great.</p>
<h3 id="d.-starting-and-faction-technologies">D. Starting and Faction
Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Technologies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>None (0 starting technologies)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> You start with ZERO technologies. You are the
only faction in the game with no starting tech.</p>
<p><strong>Faction Technologies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Exotrireme II (BBY):</strong> <em>N’orr Dreadnought - Cost: 4
| Combat: 5 | Move: 2 | Capacity: 1 | BOMBARDMENT 4 (x2) | Sustain
Damage</em></p>
<p>This unit cannot be destroyed by “Direct Hit” action cards. After a
round of space combat, you may destroy this unit to destroy up to 2
ships in this system.</p>
<p>Upgraded version of your Exotrireme I with Move 2 (instead of 1),
immunity to Direct Hit, and kamikaze ability to destroy 2 ships by
sacrificing the dreadnought.</p>
<p><strong>Valkyrie Particle Weave (RR):</strong> <em>After making
combat rolls during a round of ground combat, if your opponent produced
1 or more hits, you produce 1 additional hit.</em></p>
<p>Strong defensive ground combat tech. If your opponent gets any hits
during ground combat, you get 1 bonus hit back. Synergizes well with
your Valkyrie Exoskeleton mech’s ability.</p>
<h3 id="e.-leaders">E. Leaders</h3>
<p><strong>Agent - T’ro:</strong></p>
<p>At the end of a player’s tactical ACTION: You may exhaust this card;
if you do, that player may place 2 infantry from their reinforcements on
a planet they control in the active system.</p>
<p>Support agent. After any tactical action, exhaust to let that player
(you or opponent) place 2 free infantry on planets in active system. Use
on yourself (free reinforcements) or trade to others for favors.</p>
<p><strong>Commander - G’hom Sek’kus:</strong> <em>Unlock: Control 5
planets in non-home systems.</em></p>
<p>During the “Commit Ground Forces” step: You can commit up to 1 ground
force from each planet in the active system and each planet in adjacent
systems that do not contain 1 of your command tokens.</p>
<p>Powerful invasion commander. Easy unlock (5 non-home planets by
R2-R3). Once unlocked, when invading, you can commit ground forces from:
1. Planets in the active system (bypasses capacity requirements) 2.
Planets in ADJACENT systems (completely bypasses needing ships)</p>
<p>This lets you invade with massive armies by pulling infantry from
neighboring planets without needing ships with capacity. If invading a
system adjacent to 3 of your planets, you can commit ground forces from
all 3 for overwhelming numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Hero - Sh’val, Harbinger:</strong> <em>Unlock: Have 3 scored
objectives.</em> <strong>Tekklar Conditioning</strong> - After you move
ships into the active system: You may skip directly to the “Commit
Ground Forces” step. If you do, after you commit ground forces to land
on planets, purge this card and return each of your ships in the active
system to your reinforcements.</p>
<p>Devastating invasion hero. Move ships into system, skip directly to
invasion (no space combat), land ground forces, then your ships
disappear. Use this to: 1. Bypass enemy fleets entirely (no space
combat) 2. Invade multiple planets with ground forces 3. Sacrifice ships
(they return to reinforcements, not destroyed)</p>
<p>Example: Move 3 carriers with 12 infantry into enemy system. Hero:
Skip space combat, land 12 infantry on 3 planets, ships disappear. You
just invaded 3 planets without fighting their fleet.</p>
<h3 id="f.-promissory-note---tekklar-legion">F. Promissory Note -
<strong>Tekklar Legion</strong></h3>
<p>At the start of an invasion combat: Apply +1 to the result of each of
your unit’s combat rolls during this combat. If your opponent is the
Sardakk N’orr player, apply -1 to the result of his unit’s combat rolls
during this combat. Then, return this card to the N’orr player.</p>
<p>Decent invasion promissory. Holder gets +1 to combat rolls in ONE
ground combat. If fighting YOU (Sardakk), you get -1 (net -2 swing). Try
to sell to the active player for 2TG at the start of bigger combats and
1TG for smaller combats to not get it stuck somewhere. A few extra hits
can shift the tide of battle.</p>
<h3 id="g.-alliance">G. Alliance</h3>
<p>Quite niche for your faction but since it’s a weird ability it can
surprise people. Try to trade up to a better alliance for yours with the
argument of them not being a bug snack.</p>
<h3 id="h.-mech---valkyrie-exoskeleton">H. Mech - <strong>Valkyrie
Exoskeleton</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | <strong>Sustain Damage</strong></p>
<p>After this unit uses its Sustain Damage ability during ground combat,
it produces 1 hit against your opponent’s ground forces on this
planet.</p>
<p>One of the strongest mechs in the game. When it sustains damage
(blocks 1 hit), it produces 1 hit back. Devastating in the often short
swingy ground combats. With Unrelenting (+1), it hits on 5 instead of
6.</p>
<h3 id="i.-flagship---cmorran-norr">I. Flagship - <strong>C’Morran
N’orr</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 8 | Combat: 6 (x2) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 3 | <strong>Sustain
Damage</strong></p>
<p>Apply +1 to the result of each of your other ship’s combat rolls in
this system.</p>
<p>Stacking combat bonus flagship. Your flagship gives +1 to ALL other
ships in the system. Combined with Unrelenting (+1), your ships get +2
total: - Fighters: 9 → 7 to hit - Cruisers: 7 → 5 to hit - Dreadnoughts:
5 → 3 to hit</p>
<p>The flagship bonus gives each ship 0.1 expected extra hit. For every
10 ships you roll, you get 1 extra hit on average. Powerful boost to
your entire fleet when the flagship is present.</p>
<p><strong>Exotrireme I - N’orr Dreadnought (Special Unit):</strong></p>
<p>Cost: 4 | Combat: 5 | Move: 1 | Capacity: 1 | <strong>BOMBARDMENT 4
(x2)</strong> | Sustain Damage</p>
<p>Your unique dreadnought. Different from normal dreadnoughts: -
<strong>BOMBARDMENT 4 (x2):</strong> Normal dreadnoughts have
BOMBARDMENT 5 (x1).</p>
<p>Perfect for Sardakk’s aggressive playstyle—BOMBARD planets, land
ground forces via capacity, invade.</p>
<h3 id="j.-breakthrough---norr-supremacy-br">J. Breakthrough -
<strong>N’orr Supremacy (B&lt;&gt;R)</strong></h3>
<p>After you win a combat, either gain 1 command token or research a
unit upgrade technology. Blue and red technologies count as each other
for prerequisites.</p>
<p>This is what a breakthrough is supposed to be: game changing, faction
lifting, and just a ton of fun. Get every game.</p>
<p><strong>Combat Reward:</strong> After EACH combat victory, choose: 1.
Gain 1 command token (any pool) 2. Research 1 unit upgrade tech (must
still meet prerequisites)</p>
<p>Win 5 combats R2-R4 = gain 5 command tokens OR research 5 unit
upgrades. You convert aggression into tangible advantages. Fight
constantly, research unit upgrades from combat victories instead of
needing Technology strategy card. Winning fights to not get stalled is
fantastic for late game.</p>
<h3 id="k.-slice-and-draft-considerations">K. Slice and Draft
Considerations</h3>
<p>Sardakk wants aggressive positioning and resources:</p>
<p><strong>Speaker Order:</strong> - <strong>Prefer positions
1-3</strong> - Breakthrough guarantee in early draft. - <strong>Any
position acceptable</strong> - Slight favor to weak neighbor. - Position
matters more for slice composition/planet placements to leverage your
commander.</p>
<p><strong>Slice Priorities:</strong> - <strong>5+ planets</strong> -
Unlock commander (requires 5 non-home planets). - <strong>Planets all
the way towards Mecatol</strong> - Aggressive positioning for map
control. - <strong>Balanced slice</strong> - Resource-heavy home system
and breakthrough for tokens means balanced slices work fine. You can
work around both resource-heavy or influence-heavy slices. -
<strong>Slight favor to more influence</strong> - Your +1 combat rolls
shine with many units (not a few big ships). More influence = more
command tokens = more activations = more units. - <strong>Entropic Scar
(legendary planet)</strong> - Get a head start with bonus red tech which
is also blue. Massive advantage. Both your faction techs you would get
later or not at all but with this your combat prowess improves further.
- <strong>Hope’s End (legendary planet)</strong> - Get out early mechs
to start winning those easy ground combats. - <strong>Tech
skips</strong> - Not needed but welcome to get more avenues for
advantageous combats.</p>
<p><strong>Slice Features to Avoid:</strong> - <strong>Isolated
slices</strong> - Need neighbors to attack for breakthrough rewards. -
<strong>Anomalies in middle of slice</strong> - Asteroid fields and
gravity rifts block movement without tech you won’t get early.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iv.-structural-weaknesses">IV. Structural Weaknesses</h2>
<h3 id="a.-first-turn-priorities">A. First Turn Priorities</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1 Priority Rankings:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Breakthrough</strong> - Get N’orr Supremacy early. Game
changing, faction lifting, and essential for your strategy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology</strong> - Activate your breakthrough by
unlocking prerequisites for unit upgrades.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scoring</strong> - You can have problems with some
objectives. If you can get an early one, do it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expansion and Production</strong> - Use your strong
starting fleet to expand.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Expansion Notes:</strong> Aim for 2 strong systems nearby.
One of them should be on the way to Mecatol. We need to get some
targets…cough…neighbors.</p>
<h3 id="b.-technology-deficit">B. Technology Deficit</h3>
<p>There is definitely a tech deficit. Things are locked and you got 0
flexibility. You can catch up on unit upgrades quickly through N’orr
Supremacy, but you will never have the tech. Accept you’re tech-poor.
Use breakthrough to research unit upgrades from combat wins. Focus on
what you need, not what’s optimal.</p>
<h3 id="c.-diplomatic-weakness">C. Diplomatic Weakness</h3>
<p>You have to attack people and no one wants to be attacked. You have
to be smart and optimize the amount of attacks. Focus your aggression
strategically, not randomly. Do not be greedy and go for more than it’s
worth. Having someone on a revenge tour because you wanted an extra
token is not worth it.</p>
<h3 id="d.-over-aggression-risk">D. Over-Aggression Risk</h3>
<p>Being spread out is not that good. What you want from an enemy is a
bit of a tug of war. You take here, they win a combat there. You don’t
have to move too far to find good combats. For them, war is costly. For
you, it’s just cost of doing business.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="v.-technology">V. Technology</h2>
<h3 id="a.-overview">A. Overview</h3>
<p>You start with <strong>0 technologies.</strong></p>
<p>There’s really only 1 tech path these days: <strong>AI Development
Algorithm + Gravity Drive (B)</strong>. Use N’orr Supremacy to research
unit upgrades from combat wins.</p>
<p><strong>What AI Development Algorithm + Gravity Drive (B)
unlocks:</strong> - AI Development Algorithm + Gravity Drive (B) = 1R +
1B - With B&lt;&gt;R synergy: 3 Red OR 3 Blue (interchangeable) - AI Dev
ignores 1 prerequisite for unit upgrades</p>
<p><strong>Available unit upgrades via N’orr Supremacy:</strong> -
Carrier II (BB) - ✓ - Exotrireme II (BBY) - ✓ (AI Dev ignores yellow) -
Destroyer II (RR) - ✓ - Fighter II (GB) - ✓ (AI Dev ignores green) - PDS
II (RY) - ✓ (AI Dev ignores yellow)</p>
<p><strong>Cannot research via N’orr Supremacy:</strong> - War Sun
(RRRY) - Needs 1 more red + yellow - Infantry II (GG) - Needs 1 more
green - Space Dock II (YY) - Needs 1 more yellow - Cruiser II (GYR) -
Needs green + yellow</p>
<h3 id="b.-tech-path">B. Tech Path</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1: AI Development Algorithm (R)</strong> - When you
research unit upgrade tech, ignore 1 prerequisite. When using
PRODUCTION, reduce cost by number of unit upgrade techs you own. -
<strong>Why:</strong> Mainly for ignoring prerequisites on unit
upgrades. Lets you research more unit upgrades via N’orr Supremacy.</p>
<p><strong>Round 2: Gravity Drive (B)</strong> - +1 move to 1 ship per
activation - <strong>Why:</strong> Mobility for raids and
repositioning.</p>
<p><strong>Round 3+:</strong> Use N’orr Supremacy to research unit
upgrades from combat wins.</p>
<p><strong>Priority order for available upgrades:</strong> 1.
<strong>Carrier II</strong> - Capacity 6 for transporting armies 2.
<strong>Exotrireme II</strong> - Move 2, Direct Hit immunity, kamikaze
ability 3. <strong>Fighter II</strong> - Move 2, can move without
transport 4. <strong>Destroyer II</strong> - AFB 6 (x3) 5. <strong>PDS
II</strong> - Deep Space Cannon</p>
<p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> If taking Technology strategy card,
consider Duranium Armor (RR) or Fleet Logistics (BB) based on game
needs.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vi.-strategy-cards">VI. Strategy Cards</h2>
<h3 id="a.-round-1">A. Round 1</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1 Priority Ranking:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Trade</strong> - Breakthrough early. Flexible economy.
Careful to not give debt to targets.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leadership</strong> - Breakthrough early. Command tokens
for expansion and activations.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Politics</strong> - Breakthrough early. Setting up
flexibility for round 2.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Breakthrough early.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology</strong> - AI Dev round 1 to unlock
prerequisites.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Warfare</strong> - Combat enabler but need breakthrough
first.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Construction</strong> - Screw people out of
Warfare.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Imperial</strong> - Never R1.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you’re 6th pick as Sardakk, what did you
do?</p>
<h3 id="b.-round-2">B. Round 2+</h3>
<p><strong>Love:</strong> - <strong>Imperial</strong> - There will be
bad rounds for Sardakk so Imperial and hopefully an Imperial point is
critical to be in the running. Worst case have to use hero if heavily
reinforced by a meanie. - <strong>Warfare</strong> - Value card.
Potential of 2-3 tech and 2-3 tokens from 2 activations.</p>
<p><strong>Good:</strong> - <strong>Leadership</strong> - Command tokens
for aggression and production. - <strong>Politics</strong> - Improve
speaker order to solve objectives. - <strong>Trade</strong> - 7-9 trade
goods. Good to smooth out diplomacy but careful if diplomacy already
went bad.</p>
<p><strong>Situational:</strong> - <strong>Technology</strong> - Depends
on tech needs. - <strong>Construction</strong> - Only if needing
structures. - <strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Limited value.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vii.-intermediate">VII. Intermediate</h2>
<h3 id="a.-unit-composition">A. Unit Composition</h3>
<p><strong>Preferred Units:</strong> - <strong>Carriers</strong> -
Transport infantry for invasions. - <strong>Exotrireme</strong> -
BOMBARDMENT and combat power. War sun killer. -
<strong>Fighters</strong> - Prefer more fighters rather than 1 big
exotrireme because of Unrelenting. - <strong>Infantry</strong> - Mass
infantry for ground combat. - <strong>Mechs</strong> - Strong ground
combat presence. - <strong>Flagship</strong> - Late game power
spike.</p>
<h3 id="b.-game-plan">B. Game Plan</h3>
<p><strong>Expansion:</strong> Focus on grabbing 5+ planets to unlock
your commander. Expand toward your neighbors’ planets to set up
commander invasions from adjacent systems. Position yourself for planets
toward Mecatol. Look for 2 strong systems nearby, one of them being on
the way to Mecatol.</p>
<p><strong>Neighbors:</strong> Yes, focus on neighbors. You need planets
adjacent to enemy planets for commander invasions. Your value comes from
constant combat with N’orr Supremacy, so stay close to targets. Set up
tug-of-war positions where you can win fights without overextending.</p>
<p><strong>Mecatol Rex:</strong> Depends on the game state. Mecatol is a
planet you can grab with your hero if you have adjacent systems. Don’t
rush it early unless you can hold it. Better to pressure neighbors and
score combat objectives first.</p>
<p><strong>What to Build:</strong> Carriers for capacity. Exotrireme for
BOMBARDMENT and war sun killing. Fighters for Unrelenting value.
Infantry for ground combat. Mechs when you can for ground dominance.
Flagship late game for power spike.</p>
<p><strong>When to Have Combats:</strong> Fight as soon as you have
breakthrough unlocked. Every combat win gets you a command token or unit
upgrade tech. Don’t wait for perfect moments. Get into 2-3 combats per
round after breakthrough. Use your combat advantage to extract value
constantly. Have combats against few targets. Don’t want 3 people mad at
the same time. Always try to smooth out one relationship before
destroying another.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="viii.-objectives">VIII. Objectives</h2>
<h3 id="a.-objective-summary">A. Objective Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> N’orr Supremacy breakthrough makes every
combat profitable with command tokens or unit upgrade tech. Combat
objectives are excellent. Commander enables invasions from adjacent
systems without moving ships. Territorial objectives from aggressive
expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Tech deficit - 0 starting tech,
permanently tech-poor. Structures - no Space Dock II (YY) hurts
production scaling. Mobility early - no movement tech until round 2,
hard to reach targets without Gravity Drive (B).</p>

<p>Sardakk N’orr is Twilight Imperium’s pure combat faction. While other
factions balance multiple priorities, Sardakk focuses on overwhelming
martial superiority. Your units win fights they shouldn’t win, and every
victory makes you stronger through your breakthrough’s feedback
loop.</p>
<p>Playing Sardakk offers a completely different experience. You’re not
optimizing trade networks or racing through tech trees—you’re the
galaxy’s menace, converting violence into power. Every combat makes you
stronger, turning aggression into command tokens and technologies. You
become the table’s wild card: a constant threat that must be managed.
The faction rewards decisive, aggressive play and teaches you to embrace
conflict as a path to victory.</p>
<p>Don’t let zero starting technologies fool you. You’re not
behind—you’re playing a different game than everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>Unrelenting. Unstoppable. Victorious.</strong></p>
