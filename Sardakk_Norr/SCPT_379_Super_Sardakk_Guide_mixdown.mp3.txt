SCPT_379_Super_Sardakk_Guide_mixdown.mp3---This is Space Cat's Peace Turtles, the unofficial podcast for Fantasy Flights Twilightand Period, Episode 379, The Super Sardaknor Guide,music by Ben Prunty featuring Matt Martin and Hunter Donaldson.We made it to the end of this long journey, Hunter, of all of the Super Guides.This is actually our final Super Guide.We started this 12 years ago in days of your, and we genuinely thought, before we gotto the end of it, there'd be some factions that would get Codex 4 stuff and we wouldget to kind of wait to do theirs until then.And Arbor and Barony and Sardaknor, Super Guides just came out anyways.They just happened despite that.I didn't think, did we have any intel on there being any Sardak stuff?I actually think we were just saving Sardak.No, I think Sardak was just kind of your special boy, but also, I mean, there was a likechance, not like a big one, but it's like, yeah, I mean, they're kind of like on thebottom, you know, maybe they get one extra thing thrown in or whatever, but they've alreadygotten some stuff.So yeah, I don't think we were expecting sorry.We expected Arbor and Barony to be the last two we would do and we thought they'd getsome.Right.Right.We thought they would get stuff and that's why we planned things out long ago.We sat down and framed up this year long plan.And it didn't, some things didn't happen.Yep.Not our fault.You know who to blame.I'm not even going to say his name this week.But, you know, here we are and we finished the dang thing.And now, you know, it would be great if there was some new content injected into the game.Yeah, too bad.Too bad.That's not happening right now.Yep.But I have, I have a small slate of ideas for episodes.I'm calling kind of two a one or or also maybe even a sort of exit arc on prophecy ofkings, codex for looms.I'm not getting in any trouble here.This is they did it.You know, you know, it mostly sounds like we're just desperate to kill prophecy of kings.We get like we keep referring to the end of POK more than anything else that just exists.Trust me.Trust me.The, the hot take, which is actually ice cold take will be that prophecy of kings.That's when the game was good.Yeah.All right.I've already prepared for the codex for haters to come in big time and be like, no, goodtimes.That was the prophecy of kings.You know how people do that right now?A base game will be like base game.That was a good time.Do people do you hear?Do you hear people say?I don't feel like I hear people actually say base game was the good times.That happened whenever prophecy of kings came out and now it does.Maybe I don't I've heard it lately.We've come out.But at this point, you know, like prophecy of kings has been the law of the land for solong.I think people are just used to it.I definitely hear more.Third edition was the good old days and then you hear from some people second editionwas the good old days.And nobody talks about first edition being the good old days.But as our research projects have indicated, first edition, I think is the better one ofthe two.Yeah, I think I like first edition better than third.How far I would take that.Third edition was not the good days.Third edition sucked and we didn't know any better.And honestly, if I had been as plugged into board games, then as I am now, there ain't noway in heck I would have been playing Twilight Imperium.Are you kidding me?That's really funny.Wow.There's no way.There's no way, man.Third edition was up there.2005.Yeah.No, I am excited because hopefully 2025 is we've been doing this a history project veryslowly and only a little bit.And we still kind of owe like a second edition, one more like second edition episode problemis.Can't find the ding dang thing to like properly play.That's like what the prerequisite is for a second edition episode is sitting down andplaying a full copy of it and been reaching out to people have not found one that I considerI know what people own it in the world, but I'm not traveling to like Rochester to go playyour second edition.But I've been trying to find one in the Twin Cities.So I'll say it here, if you're in or near the Twin Cities and you have a copy of secondedition, especially with the expansion, seriously hit me up.But yeah, all that to say the next thing to do would be to start like a proper historyproject on third edition and go through that and I'm actually very excited at the prospectof that.I'm curious to go back to third edition at this point.Yeah, and I also feel like the history of third edition is maybe the most in like I mean,there's the most to talk about.Yeah, we could do much more than two episodes if we wanted to.And being truly honest, like really throwing all the cards on the table, third edition actuallyis first edition.First edition and second edition, that's just not the same game, y'all.It's just not, it smells like the same game, but it just isn't fundamentally, it's waytoo different.And then third edition, it's like, okay, this is the rough draft of what would be fourthedition.And then I'm sure fourth edition is going to feel like the rough draft compared to fifthedition.No, I think fifth edition is going to be the spaghetti's back on the wall.Yeah, fifth edition is going to be more of a third edition and sixth edition, that willbe more of a fourth edition.So we look forward to like rebooting this show in 2045 for the sixth edition version ofitself.When do you think we will quit?Oh man, that's a real question.And actually it's kind of appropriate to ask on this a day where we complete a yearslong, I don't even want to call it project.I want to call it a cycle.Yeah, we're going to do this, these cycles, you know, if FFG gets someone horrible to makefifth edition, we'll have some weird, we'll have to be pretty weird about it.Oh yeah, because our relationship with Dana is that we love everything that he does.Well, we like Dana.We like Dana.Yeah, true.So I put up with his nonsense, his creus nonsense.Yeah, but you are right of like, what if they pick someone that we just don't like getalong with that well?And then the stuff coming out is, yeah, that could be tough.That could be tough.It almost feels like they should reach out to us.Yeah, maybe it's a really easy way to make sure we keep doing this show.And they're like, we do not care.If you keep doing this, honestly, stop.They have sent me a season to assist for my letters.I have to ask them so many times.That would be the best way for the show to end is that fantasy play just one day, one daythey just wake up and we all, and it's not even just us is everybody.Like everybody just wakes up and they've gotten like a letter.Like everyone that works on a sink, all the everyone that were, yeah, Darryl, TTPG people,like Phil Roy, like every, the entire community.Yep.Just wakes up one day to a season to assist forFFG being like, do not do stuff anymore.It's going to look like this.Embrace their group is like truly shuttered.They sell off Asmode to Sony and Sony is like, get rid of all of this crap.It's all gone.We don't want it.They're like, listen, Twilight Imperium is going to become a first person shooter, allright?And Bungie is going to develop games for it.We're going to fuse the Halo universe, the Destiny universe and Twilight Imperium.It's all going to be one big universe.That's the new way.All right.Wow.That would actually be funny if people started taking fictional universes and incorporatingthem like the way that people do that with corporations.Right.Yes.It was just like one day we woke up and it was like, Sony has combined the Spider-Mancinematic universe with, you know, like, I feel like what you're describing is simplythe 80s where it's like, the Harlem Globetrotters are on an episode of Scooby-Doo and you're right.Yeah.Transformers and GI Joe take place in the same canonical universe.Yeah.Yeah.We need to get into the crossover business.How come we don't just host some true crime show, occasionally in lieu of, you know, andthen some other people come host our show, you know what I mean?Like, well, we could do a true crime show, couldn't we?You've done a true crime show before.I mean, it was a true crime comedy show, but I don't know if it was real.I honestly wasn't even thinking about that.I forgot that I would did do a true crime show.I put out to Hannah and Allison, they are not listening, but I do miss them.I used to, I mean, I used to meet with them every single week.It was really nice.I love to do that.But yeah, no, it does not, I don't even think that exists anymore.I'm pretty sure.Like, the feed is just gone completely.I think the feed might be gone because I looked at that one time and only the last coupleepisodes, like the last like three were on the feed and nothing else was available.That's another reason to get this show properly on YouTube is someday when we want to stoppaying pod being the coast stuff and we don't know what else to do and we don't know howelse to fix the problem.That is the Chris, like I was thinking about that as far as like Link Rock goes is that likethat basically the situation is that we will have to pay if we want our podcasts to survive,even if we quit doing it, we will have to pay a pod being the rest of our days.And then once we pass on from this earth, if we wanted it to continue, we would haveto like have like a trust.Yep, Molly has to keep paying pod being until she dies.That she passes it down to her children.I want my great, great, great, great grandchildren to be listening to this show and play TwilightImperium grumpily.I want them to be grump.Mommy, what's a subreddit?Yeah, well, Hunter, I would now like to take you first.Okay, you're on camera and I have this and here we go.I'm going to hold this up and I'd like you to now look at it and I just like you to focuson the object shaking back and forth in front of you.It's not even that shiny.It's not that shiny, but I'd just like you to really, really lure yourself in and nownow you're drifting off to sleep and it's time for you to do this Sardak guide in your sleeplike you've promised many, many times.Now your eyes are closed and you may begin the Sardak nor guide.I hope you know that I don't think that the at the work, when I say do it in my sleep,I'm at more riding the outline.But also now this.And because now you're asleep and the audience gets to picture the rest of this episodewith Hunter's eyes closed.Okay, so that's yeah, all right.So do I need to be, so I should be sleepy.I guess that'll be so hard for me to figure out.Let's bring the energy cataclysmically low.Mm-hmm.Yeah, and God, it'll be so hard for me to do here at 8 a.m.when we wake up to record vision record.Yeah, it's a weird time.It's a weird time to be a podcaster in our lives.Oh, it's a horrible time to be a podcaster.Also, good luck to, you know, every time we do this, I'm like, man, this is a good timebecause this sucks for my girlfriend.But who is, like, ill and asleep or trying to sleep right now in the other room?And I am an annoying person who is loud, cackling, the microphone in the other room.Mm-hmm.But okay, start agnore, let's get going.What do we got?First of all, start act, that's a lady.Oh, I just genuinely did this.I'll start with some lore.The whole Gama Mama thing, Sardak is a lady.We kind of have that actually locked down.They kind of made sense to be, I mean, we did get the whole, the reason we call it Gama Mamais that it does, I feel like it does have a, the pronoun.I feel like is she, which is I think where we got the whole thing?For Gama Seconds?For Gama Seconds.Oh, I think that we're renowned for her vicious raids.Oh, cool.Yeah, yeah.So, so Gama Mama, that is based on something.And then Sardak is the name of their queen mother that they like to, and so basically, andI think that's why I love these guys so much is that essentially the Sardak Nora are abunch of bug boys who listen to mommy.And all they do is talk about mommy.They're a bunch of mommy boy, little bug boys.And they love mommy.Just like Hunter.Just like Hunter.And they're flying around causing chaos, stirring up trouble wherever they go, all in the nameof their mommy who is Sardak.How often do you picture the movie Starship Troopers when you are thinking about the SardakNora?Because for me, it's all the time.It's never, really.I think about that final scene or close to final scene when the weird pink brain one comesdown and eats the person's whole head, eats the brain out of, sucks the brain out ofso it's, I just want to see that.I want the artwork of that Sardak Nora out there somewhere in the universe.Doesn't Michael Ironside have, is that like great line where, where they have, there'sso many great lines of Starship Troopers, but they like find, they like go to that outpostwhere, where they find like all the bodies and somebody asks like, what happened to them?And Michael Ironside just looks at them and looks at the person and just goes, it'ssuck their brain.He's like really like straight.Just like, so funny.That movie is such a blast to watch just because of like, I mean, I know most people knowthis, but like the whole idea having like, you have your, your older cool actors like MichaelIronside and then like, Clancy Brown.And then you have these like young like, not to be rude to them, but like these youngeractors that like clearly do not really understand like the deeper implications of how funnythis is.And they're doing like their whole thing like straight up, they're beautiful person,be less than interstake.Yeah, they're like a hotty, it's like they're like on a Disney Channel made for TV movie.And then like Michael Ironside like under, like actually gets what's happening.And it's so cool.That's like such a specific tone where you've got some people that are doing, they're deliveringall of their lines from the script like, like just as if there's no sarcasm.Yeah.But there's nothing, they're not giving any side eye to it.And then Michael Ironside is turning it up just a little, just enough where you're like,oh, he knows.He does what's going on here.And it's so good.Man, that guy is so funny.People don't talk enough about how funny Michael Ironside is.He is hilarious.And then like Neil Patrick Stewart, he gets it.No, yeah, that's right.Yeah.No Patrick Stewart.No, Neil Patrick Stewart.No, Neil Patrick Stewart.I'm sorry.This is tough.Neil Patrick Stewart though, that is a guy.You can type that in a mid-journey right now.Mid-journey's going to have no problem with that one.Mid-journey's like, oh, I got you on this.Yeah, I know how to make Neil Patrick Stewart.I can do that.I can do that.Starship Troopers, great movie, Star Dagnore, great, fun, and cherry infection.Well, you know.We did it.Yeah.Can we talk about what they have?Hey, both, both, designed by a weird Dutch man.Very good.All right.Good.We made a connection.Let's talk about what they have then.What the bugs start with.One of the things they start with is nothing.They do in fact have zero technologies to their name at the beginning of the game.They are the only faction in the game with no tech.This is out of nowhere to be clear, too.Third edition, they started with plenty of tech.They had stuff.Oh, yeah.They were not a tech-less faction.They just decided to hated them and wanted them to be horrible monsters in fourth edition.Somebody was talking about this in the preerata, but they used to start with deep space canonbasically, or they used to be very close to it, which is weird.It's weird to think of them as a PDS faction.Yeah.Well, because deep space canon was kind of just a preer requisite for upgrading your cruisers,like the only way you can get the plus one, your cruisers or whatever, was deep spacecanon, right?Yeah.Thank you.And it's start is two carriers, one cruiser, five infantry, one space dock, one PDS, nodouble, exception is any fighters to speak of.Yeah.None at all.And it makes your start really dumb looking most of the time.And it's just, I don't know, that's just how it is, no fighters.It's so weird, too, because it bothers me so much that there's no fighters because theyare a fighter factor.Right.I mean, like, legitimately.Not even just like, this isn't just our interpretation of it.Yeah.In the lore, they're just talking about swarms.Right.It's all about swarming.Mm-hmm.And what?You can't swarm, it's the only thing you swarm with in Twilight and Period of Misfightersand they start with zero.It's really nuts.Their home system is a two planet home system.They have a Kienara, which is a three resource, one influence planet.Am I doing the lore?You want to hit me?You want to give me that juice?I'll give you that juice.Oh, fantastic.- And enormous and oceanless, not only the largest planet supporting sentient life, but also the one with the least moisture. These baby dry home to the Sardak knowing high cities.- Wow, the largest planet supporting sentient life are the Titans not considered sentient life isn't elicium, bigger.- Yeah, that's something to look at too. I wonder if this is a lore inconsistency. I don't know.- I think we found a lore inconsistency in my friends, but also is it a lore inconsistency or is it that the Titans did not exist until the timeline gets to Prophecy of Kings, or at least they do not reawake it?- Until the Prophecy of Kings. - We just don't know that we didn't know they were there.- I don't know. Their second planet is Trenlach. It is a one resource, zero-influenced trashcan, and Hunter, that lore says...- I see, and that's all it. Other than the ferocious snow-drax, and the rare ice-moved flowers, life is restricted to the no-boom towers and ice mines.- Boom towers, huh? Why would you need a mine for ice? What is that? What? I can't hear boom towers without thinking of boom-hour from King of the Hill.- Oh! - So now the bugs talk like him. - Okay, everyone can on the boom-hour then.- When I ain't going to die of pain, again, then ice mines can be in the ice-moved flowers, y'all know where it's all right.- Yeah, that was pretty good. - Not pretty good.- They have three commodities, which is fine, I guess. Their abilities read as such. Unrelenting, apply plus one to the result of each of your units combat roles.You get a reminder here, a little plus one triangle underneath all of your combat roles. This importantly does not apply to ability roles like space cannon or anti-fighter barrage or bombardment, but in a combat, the dicey role, they're going to be a plus one.- Yes, and that's another difference from third edition, third edition combat roles were combat roles. All the roles were combat roles, maybe.And then now with dang fourth edition, we got these ability roles. - They did worse. - Just made it worse. That's the only ability on their sheet. They do have a special dreadnought, though.So their exo-try-ream is a cost four, five combat, move one, capacity one, sustained damage. It's all normal except the bombardment is a little bit better.- Um-hm. - Bambariment four and you get two dice, which is pretty good. - Pretty good. Pretty cool.- Although, like, you think about that compared to super dreads and it's like for round one, super dreads are infinitely better because they just have one extra capacity.- And yeah, need this bombardment until like round four or whatever. - Also exo-try-reams are just, it's not necessarily a dreadnought faction.- I mean, like, we will talk about exo-try-ream too whenever we get to the tech paths, but like, it doesn't very naturally play into their advantage. They're so clearly a carrier to faction that maybe even doesn't have ships sometimes if they don't need to.Or if they get in such a bad situation where they cannot manage that, but they can get on just fine without going exo-try-ream too.And exo-try-ream one, getting an extra die on bombardment, well, like, lots, like plasma scoring exists.- Yeah. - So, like, there are other factions that have this, basically, the same functionality.- Yeah. - It is puzzling and I wish that they had had a, I actually just wish they had had a special carrier instead of a special dread die. It would have been more appropriate, emphatic force, RDA.- Other flagship is the "Come on, Norr!" which now that we know "Norr" means "Y'all, come on, we have to mean, think, means, come on."- So, "Come on, y'all, come on, y'all, come on, Norr!"- Yeah. - Is the canonical name of the flagship. It's all the standard stats, but it does hit 2/6, which is then with your ability boosted to a 5.So, it's like a "fake" good flagship. It is, in fact, as good as all the others.But, em, it also has the ability "Apply" plus 1 to the result of each of your other ships combat roles in this system.So, it is also there to not boost itself, but boost other ships. And we haven't talked about the math yet, we will later, but this, of course, also makes, like, fighters even better.Now they're at plus 2 in the system, which is pretty nuts.- Yeah, yeah, it gets quite ridiculous. And if you get fighter 2, that's plus 3. - Yeah.- And if you play fighter prototype, you're just, you stop rolling. You just don't need to roll anymore at a certain point.I think morale, let's see, let's, okay, hang on, hold on, now we're in the sauce. What is it?- 8. - We're on a 9. We're on a 7 with the 2-star capabilities. We're on 5 with whatever we just said, the fighter prototype.We're on a 4 with morale boost. What else did you say? Is that it? Is that as low as we can get our fighters down to rolling on a 4?- Yeah, we were talking prophecy of X, right? - Sure. - And we're on a 3. Can we get it to an automatic hit? I don't think we can.- I don't think we can. - But we can get it to a really more than we can get. We can turn our fighters into war sons. And that's all that matters.- That's pretty sick. - Our mech is the Valkyrie Exo Skeleton. It is standard stats for a mech 2 combat in a 6, but of course boosted.So actually our mech hit on the 5. After this unit uses its sustained damage ability during ground combat, it produces one hit against your opponent's ground forces on this planet, which is an ability we will hear again in a slightly different context a little bit later.But this is a pretty nice little thing on our mech.- Yep, yeah, I like it. It's very effective. It's a great mech ability. It's really the only issue it ever runs into is going up against the Mentech mech, because of course that one turns off the ability to use sustained damage.So that's no go, but beyond that, like there's not really any special considerations for it. It just does a hits hard. It does well. It's going to combo quite nicely with our commander and it's sick. I love it.- Slightly annoying against, like if you're invading a planet with a pds, because if that pds does get hits and you wanted to soak the hits on your mech, you remove this, like this, this ability won't proc.So you like then are forced to decide am I actually going to kill an infantry right now so that I can just make this pop off harder, but you know, that's all.- I will say this, I do not like that it's a Valkyrie excess skeleton because I feel like the tech lar in the in the lore is described as an order of nights, which I think is hilarious.But Valkyrie that doesn't have anything to do with like tectonic nights or like you know, it's like that you're in the wrong strut of the world now. Yeah, we're crossing the streams here. We're going, we're going a little biking now.- Oh, suddenly that's I think that's a little odd.- They're promising or promise or a note is tech lar Legion at the start of a ground combat apply plus one to the result of each of your units combat roles during this combat.So in additional or this is a plus one for somebody else if your opponent is the y'all player apply minus one to the results of each of their units combat roles during this combat then return this to the y'all player.So this is worse against the person who could be giving it out to people.Yeah, yeah, so it's it's a little bit obnoxious in that way and notably like none of the other faction promise or I know so I feel like have this dynamic to it, which really in like modern day space cast, we startle style meta.You'll never run into this problem because people generally trade like notes like this in the window that they're going to be used.But you know it's important to remember that you you can give this out and we have a horrible economy anyway so you might you might want to just trade this if you can do whatever you can with it.Let's go over their leaders. Their first their agent is T-Row. Trow the tech lar ligial air.Oh, sorry hunter for our performance segment.We made the tech law of the agents are feared by all the foes across the galaxy. They do not fear us because of our strength. No, we are my team. They do not fear us because of our numbers. No, we are many. They fear us because we strike hard. We strike fast.And as long as one of us is alive, we do not stop.Oh, they filled that card up with words. Yeah, dude for a faction that I didn't even realize had mouths. They talk a lot. I feel like is the is a big talker.Big talker. They're big. They're chatty. They're chatty little bug boys who love their mommy.They're just like players tactical action. You may exhaust this card if you do that player may place two infantry from their reinforcements on a planet. They control in the active system. So it's kind of like a little soul ability to drop two friends, but it's only after attack collection and it's only once per round.Is this an okay. Do we care about this? Yeah rules. Okay, I don't know why you're I don't know why you're dumping cold water on it. It's a really great ability.I don't I mean, it's obvious why it's good. It's like one of the problems we would run into if not for this. It would be production capacity.But the fact that we're getting to infantry for free on the front lines also combos pretty well with what we're about to read.Yeah, Commander.I didn't realize you typed it out.Yeah, that's the that is the canonical spelling of how that's how you say gamma mama.Yeah, the Valkyrie elite you unlock it by controlling five planets in non-home systems, which is an interesting task and they are.Oh, sorry, I keep almost reading. I'm just you've got this for better so well. I keep almost reading your your parts.I'm now for her vicious raid and surprise assaults and to animate territory. And her Valkyrie command those are the elite and God of the swan.Asked armies.Turn into a little fly there. Very good.During the commit ground forces step you can commit up to one ground force from each planet in the active system and each planet in adjacent systems that do not contain one of your command tokens.Yeah, baby, you can just send in infantry from neighboring systems.So this is essentially a this is like a faction sheet ability, type ability.Right.That is just sitting there on the commander it transforms the faction everything that we knew about start ignore and base game pivots around this idea.And you can build very viable strategies at every every start ignore when.As a little bit to do with gamma mama, unless like everyone just fell asleep right and just let you have a good time, which does have to be fair that does have that can also take that like an absolutely.I feel like there's two different ways this ability shakes out to it is there is either.You you had so many like infantry nearby gamma mama can just act as additional capacity right like it's just the idea that like I can bring as many fighters and infantry as I can hold and I can bring like three more.But sometimes it's also like a much sneakier goofier little weird devil that sneak stuff into places you forgot gamma mama could get into.Yes players are not used to like playing against start agnor I think a lot of people don't prefer to play start agnor and a lot of times.You can find players caught on a wears because they are not thinking about gamma mama basically it is a high profile ability that people do forget.But also not even just that it's it's to me the real beauty of it is that we do not have to send our ships into enemy territory in order to invade enemy territory so we can skip space combat which you might lose in space right so like the likelihood that you could win.One ground combat is much higher than you winning a space battle basically and it's notably one ground force not one infantry so you could have three max part near someone and send three or four of them into a thing and yes I mean that's a that because those are those are start act max that's not just max those are max hitting on a five and every time you deal it back then they kill even more stuff those are gonna steam roll pretty much anything so like it's it's a ridiculously sizable force.That start agnor can just like sneak into places there are a lot of confusing aspects of this card so much so that there's an entire section in what is called the day in FAQ it is the semi official list of answers day has given us to questions that have not made their way into the living rules reference even though this document is like two years old or maybe even older at this point there still was never time to fold this stuff directly into the living rules reference which is gonna be.Evident right out the gate but let's go through some of these questions just to better understand how gomsecus works so hunter does a ceasefire promise or you know have any impact on committing ground forces from adjacent planets via sardak nor is commander gomsecus yeah well I wish that it did not.I'll say that my inter-pricion rules was I think ceasefire shouldn't work yeah at one point it didn't there was there was a tournament where it didn't happen and yeah that was cool surprise yeah.But the answer is that we will change commit ground forces in the L.R. are to say move to ensure that ceasefire works will also prevent units from being committed to planets in anomalies without the appropriate technology or through warm home warm holes if enforced travel ban is a law now what's funny if that kind of actually call something out which is like you can do this through warm holes yeah which doesn't make a whole lot of sense just I guess.I guess the bugs are just flying through warm holes I mean they are flying through space already so there we go yeah it's funny the amount of like things we have in the game now that kind of just can fly through space like I'm thinking about a urgent max that just sort of like I'm and me to I'm I'm flying around like we just have all the characters that can just fly around in space second question can the start act or player commit ground forces via their commander gomsecus on defense now the only the actor player can command.The actor player commit ground forces which that I feel like didn't even need to be explained it wasn't there so I thought well let's throw it does using domino's orb allow the start act or player to commit ground forces via their commander gomsecus I know I'm able to move but I'm able to move from systems with tokens.gomsecus is explicitly preventing committing from systems with tokens and domino's orb is per several steps for commitment takes place I will say this is part of a day and I think rule of like rules which is that the game has no memory.So if you have to remember something outside of a step generally day is opposed to it not to say that that does happen obviously writers would be a good example of something that happens sort of that out of sequence that way but yeah day doesn't like for you to remember stuff this is a classic example to though of one that really feels like day does not like that you could do this and is trying his best to to make it make sense to not allow it if it was ghost you think he'd be saying that yeah if it was ghost he'd be like oh yeah do surethat goes can do anything sounds good to you can go to shoot pds through their flagship why not we we had this thing recently at leader games and this just speaks to like how dumb board games are and if you're like a very legalistic person in the board games base you are useful but you are also a hugethorn in a very select group of people side it's like a beneficial thorn but boy is it annoying to please the like perfect text people at leader games we try to get around things like this by saying if a card says cannot it isabsolutely overrides other rules right right and this is this is like a perfect kind of ability where like what day is suggesting is because gomsecus says you cannot move from systems with command tokens that's like absolute thatthat's overriding even the move rules where you normally can't come from a whatever but we had a thing at leader games recently where we had a bunch of cards that were trying to allow things and but and would say you can tax fromon loyal cities or whatever you can tax from rival cities some some version of that and it didn't work because can is not absolute we only said cannot is absolute which means for the erata of all those cards we had to turn them all intonegative like you cannot not tax and whatever just a police such a dumb nightmare or if I I'd never want to see cannot not in my life that's not I started I was earned that is not Englishokay so our final our final gomsecus question is can start agnore's commander gomsecus be used without moving any ships into the access system which technically hunter you kind of have already answeredyet but yes you can the commander can allow start agnore to commit ground forces without moving in it's the best the best the best part of the faction the other best part of the faction is their hero is name is chivalor shival or we're going to call him shovel he's the shovel harbinger master of the first the first shovel I think master the first shovel hunter give me that flavor textthe burning exo try we told the sky before crashing into the grass covered flames actress you open and shaball as the upper first I tried to block in there so is the act ofthe high thanks for reading that so slowly the ability you unlock this called tech lar conditioning it is the brewed swarm after you move ships into the act of system you may skip directly to the commit ground forces step if you do after you commit ground forces to land on planets purge this card and return eachof the act of system to your reinforcements so you knew all of your ships but your stuff gets to the ground in addition to our ability that lets us send stuff from other planets skipping the space comment oh yeah skip directly to the commit ground forces that I mean we can definitely gamayeah we definitely gonna gama if we can yeah a lot times you can't but yeah this is a this is one of those handful of abilities in the game that we would describe as win slay abilitiessardak's got one baby there the least likely to use it but they do got it all right it's in it's in the kit even if you never have a win to set up they is worth slaying someone else's although some people do win slayregardless of whether they can win or not I'm just not really that's not necessarily my vibe whenever it comes to plan all twilight andperiod sure if I can't win then you ain't getting my stuff I ain't gonna help you win your game it is a ridiculous ability because you can like it because you know you're skipping to the ground comment it's like let's say we haveparked outside of someone's home system we send in two fully loaded carriers fully loaded and the two planets had some more infantry I don't know why we had eightcountry next to someone's home system except for because we wanted to set up for this but eight infantry can then invade the home system with no no space combat to speak ofyeah yeah it's it's pretty great and there's a lot of there's a lot of times where a faction will be set up in such a way as to where they are basically bullet proofexcept for this yeah so even you know even something like benediction might not be enough but this it gives you a lot of leeway I feel like you can take a planetprovided it's you know not you know let's see who who doesn't worry about this I guess necro doesn't worry about this is there are someI was gonna say necro is a funny case though because like necro's whole thing is they stop people from even getting to the ground so they doput a bunch of ground forces on the ground like you like you actually might come in with enough to have something to say about thatbecause you're not worried about those ground forces fighting in the sky and decimating maybe tightens then would be an exampleof somebody that probably doesn't fear this yeah if they if they but I guess any any faction would fear it if they haven't built enoughright ground forces and then attack being that mech call out from earlier is the only one I can think of where they've gotthey've got a bunch of mechs at home you might have no good yeah men tag is bad there texts are exotryering to which is of course ournot upgrade to blues one yellow it changes not a whole lot stats wise it just gives us the move to but this unit is cannot bedestroyed by direct hit action cards that's our normal dread not to upgrade and then after a round of space combat you maydestroy this unit to destroy up to two ships in this system break this down for me.So you after after the round is after we assign hits you have to still have the you can't kill the exotry room to with a hit you could sustain it.And then after all the hits are signed you could destroy your exotry rooms and destroy two ships in the system and I'm and you choose because of thething yeah what that means is that you're going to say like OK those two are dead right could be a war son could be whatever you dohave to remember capacity is not checked until end of combat so it's not like if you destroy capacity unit that somehow likein the combat or whatever.But a lot of times this can be pretty devastating yeah and it is a great ability that we probably won't get to a lot ofit's a lot of time and we probably don't have the gas to use which is kind of a bummer it is it's funny though because it's like because it doesn't come up all the time.It is a funny little surprise thing I have at least in an assing game where it's even easier to forget things I have been completely caughtunaware is by someone having this because I forgot they maybe had researched this deep and the thing with exotry room is if you want to invade somethingor is you need at least three carriers or three units with capacity because they get to just kill the two carriers outright as long as they survive like a singleround of ground combat they just kill their own dread knock out your carriers and then that's even less capacity you have to take out someone who's really good on the ground like they're already very good on the ground defense.So getting stuff from Sardak nor who have this ability is extraordinarily hard and I'm bringing this up only to say like it's extra easy to forget those are there doing that because you really don't see it every game it is not just this assumption that the exotry roomto is have are on the board so it's real mean it's a real mean ability yeah they're unquestionably great they are just also attack and we're yeah we're not going to be when we start with zero tech and that's going to bother us forever rightour our other tech is to read deep so it completely polar opposite side of the spectrum so we start with no tech and we have two techs totaling seven if we wanted to get both of our faction techs we would need seven technologies just make that clear it's calledValkyrie particle weave after making combat roles during a round of ground combat if your opponent produced one or more hits you produce one additional hit so just like our mix except for it's not limited to sustain damage is just if we are delta hit we deal a hitthere's another question from the FAQ does Valkyrie particle we've trigger after hits were produced is the hits were canceled yes the hit from Valkyrie particle weave is still applied so you can suffer no act ofeffectively no hits and then still deal one back it's an interesting tech very situational and with two red or you can me get out of here get out of here to get out of here foreveryeah there's fun I mean it is like it's hilarious how potent it could be if we ever were going to get it the idea that we would sustain amech and that mech also took a damage so our mechs would deal two hits just for being hit and then probably roll the hit because it's a 60% chance to hit it's I we woulddecimate ground combat but we kind of already we have bombardment two on a four we have good ground versus like this screen win more yeah it'sso win more very well a deep tech tech path we're not going so goodbye Valkyrie particle weave you're cool and I remember early p.o.k days when people really tried to make you workbut the proof is in the pudding I haven't seen this tech researched in a year and a half one of the lowest research rates I would I would wager yeah just might be like technically a good tech you know what I mean that's the weirdest thingsomething like L4 disruptors on barony where it's like well this is just trash that you need it but this is like this other problem this is like indicative of so many other things going wrongit's just it's not good enough though is the problem like it's just not enough to to justify it doesn't like in it again it doesn't like expand their skill set really at all so it's just kind of likeyeah I think I can win some ground combat that don't need I don't need to go down red in order to make that happen right and I'm not I'm we when we get to tech path I mean the tech pathdiscussion is very important for start ignore obviously and I'm not very in favor of really red path at all not to blow any ones mine on space cats flu turtles but I'm I'm just not it's I don't think it's smart enough basically and I think they have to be really smart on tech in order to be successfulwell walk me through what makes this a faction click what's wise a good wise a bad well rolling dice is a big one I'll play that much we we're pretty good at that we've covered it before about it's we're stating paradoxically start act is more about the little guys as far asthere rolling advantage infantry and fighters get a more a bigger boom right to the plus one in your big capital ships right it also it helps with your the way I like to do it in my headwhenever I'm playing by the imperialist I I do a lot of cowboy math is what I call it I don't really like to look at the odds on TI4 battle and that's the this isn't a point of pride it's because I think looking atfor battle you're always going to forget a possibility if you look into your battle is going to give you a percentage chance and you're going to trust that you'regoing to believe in that which is going to make it sting even more when they happen to have X yeah car action card that then changes the math so much right right now you're60% chance just goes right into the toilet is like a 30% chance to win off of a single action card play if you listen to your heart every time it feels better when yousucceed in it doesn't feel as bad when when you don't because you're like well what is my heart suppose I was my heart suppose to know that my heart can't know these things my heartcan't the world in the bottle heart just loves mommy. Mm-hmm. Oh my heart does love mommy start act my mommy. Yeah so so definitely like the way that I like to think about a cowboymath style is that we're going to get more incidental hits like I it's not that I just assume I'm going to get more hits in general basically every time Ihave a dread not I'm like that dread not might hit you know what I mean but with with Sardak you kind of just think like I don'tknow I got a bunch of stuff some of it might hit yeah yeah it's just kind of generally have the cowboy math goes which is great. We're also like the onlyfaction I think that I mean besides maybe in that can survive without any ships which I think is everyone's favorite aspect of SardakNor right we are like pretty and it's not that you should your goal shouldn't be I'm going to lose all my ships that I have noships that shouldn't be your goal it's a bad goal if you're meaming like that don't mean like that come on y'all but you might end up inthat position because you also kind of suck basically we have need the command tokens for secondary is another stuff you justdesperately need to do other things oh yeah yeah yeah we'll talk about the problems in just second but they are obvious and they areloud we got a win slate hero that's pretty cool in situations where you are winning from ahead or you're in thepack or you're doing well that win slate hero is critical big time critical but we are a poor we are a poor little bug yeah and mommy is soso far away and I don't know when she's coming back right so the win slate is sort of for I don't know those that's more of arich boy thing you know what I mean win slate that's more of a you know boarding school boy kind of thing where we go to Harvardyeah we didn't go to Harvard we're just a simple poor arm and bug boy who love his mama working in the ice minds y'all working in the ice minds yeah yeah just working in theice minds XO2 is a wild ability it was good in base game it's still good in prophecy of kings but that's rich boy stuff yeah we in a rich boy we're talking richboy stuff today XO2 if you got XO2 and the other stuff that I want you to get you have a great day and congrats to you and I like it but we're not going to plan on youhaving XO2 every time because it's it just doesn't it doesn't flow we want still we want our abilities to all flow together we wanted it allto sync up and kind of play off of each other because I think that will add up to be the most successful stuff if you zoom out yeah would you say there's like a noticeable difference in thefeeling of a sardak in a game where tech pop off you got like the tech agendas and you got a tech writer or whatever like even just like two additional tech forhard act is that how big of a difference is that that's huge yeah yeah yeah the idea of like a sardak no well let's talk about this the lightweight deflectors in a world where you have lightweightdeflectors you basically it to choose whatever target you want your hero you could be ahead in a way that you are probably not in a worldwhere you don't have that and being able to slay whoever is in front of you and also say like OK also have XO2's or like there's a world where you have so much tech that sardak nor looks like L1 Z1like that is a distinct possibility yeah I don't even think I've played that game yeah I've never even played that game and I love playing sardakit does feel like there is a Christmas land situation or sardak basically exerts its will on the table and does whatever it wants and stops everybody basically I love thewe are out of we got that that sort of specifically noted that technically sardak nor and L1 both start the same distance away from their dread not upgrades because L1 starts a green in a redwhich is a beautiful little point but the bigger thing is I mean your L1 dreads are just doing so much more than the sardak dreads are doing you don't actually have like a huge reason to invest in building and upgrading the the dreads for sardakL1 Z1 X does not have to get any additional unit upgrades to be viable then they're super dreads basically yeah the super dreads and that is goodthat is not true for sardak nor you carry your two is essentially in my opinion right let's talk about problems though we are we basically are talking about them which is that we don't start with any tech that's badit's really horrible yeah it's really cannot be overstated how horrible that is tech tempo always will be bad if they're tech objectives go homeyeah just be like no I don't know I guess I lose not a big deal we got a horrible economy to go with our bad tech where three commodity faction which it could be worse we have under love promise or you know we have a we have aalliance that frankly has more potential than people give it but I I can't sell the dang thing I don't know if you can but it's hard to sellI think that it shouldn't be I think I think people should like plan on giving sardak nor a lot of money yeah or it but it also it is a little tricky because basically unless you're going to be punching you're not going to get a lot out of it and I sort of don't like to buy something if I know I have to punchyeah to make it worth anything right and fighting in general isn't a great way to score points right so we just like have an issue here of just like yes we're good at fighting but being good at fighting sucksyeah and it's not important I mean the S tier is not a bunch of factions that are good at fighting right you know yeah it's the classic early example ofuh sardak nor especially when they were only like ten factions or six before ti three or whatever it's the classic example of like well this is a really simpleaction let's give it to our new friend the new player can just see plus one to combat and they'll they won't have too much to think about and then they have a bad time because they never accomplish anything and they don't even getraised their ability because they can't find times to fight or when they do choose to fight it doesn't advantage their game in any way stop don't the I will always announce this PSA when it comes time don't givenew players start ignore it's a horrible starting faction one of the worst because it's so simple that they don't get to do anything fun right the POK stuff is at least moreinteresting they'll get to do that but they won't know how to like utilize it in their very first game so you might as well give them I I go the opposite way people really a lot of times tryto like say like don't do Jol-n-R don't do a sorrow it'll be too much to read readings half the fun in twilight and period honestly like I think for yourfirst game when you are just overwhelmed period it's not more interesting to just like have less to do it's more interesting to read abunch of abilities and try to think of when you could use it so yeah don't don't give people the bugs on their first game not not a good planI wouldn't even say that the bugs have a good advantage when it comes to combat because if you think about it lots offactions have advantages or combat but it's in the form of ability role advantages right and I would say overall those advantages a lot better a lotbetter to have I think Argent flight better at combat yeah in sardak nor right maybe not on the ground but just generally thelike if the whole thing is sardak nor they're the ones that are good at fighting except for all the other factions that are good atfighting and while those factions will be good in different ways they'll be like oh I've got I've got space cannon I've got youknow whatever utility I've got more so like more sustained damage it's like all these different ways of people are good at fightingand sardak nor is only good at the combat roles ice ice I say this that's the worst way to be good at fighting yeah the thing thatreally excels out in my opinion is versatile ground combat yeah but in the air I wouldn't even say that they'renecessarily good right that I really aren't and like it's not actually that big of an advantage plus one it's not a huge deal lots of peopleget like like it's all got three morale boosts they just play whenever you're out of combat plus onenow you're also sardak nor I guess or like you know a lot of times I end up using that plus one trying to make it work with with fighters but guess whatthere's another faction not a loop or any faction with fighter to they also got plus one to their fighters like it's there's a lot of times wheresardak nor is basically just rolling the same kind of die that another faction is rolling yep so yes they're good at fighting but not a lotnot like big time yeah yeah yeah well let's take a quick break and we will talk about our our game long strategies what we'redoing from round one onward[Music]space cat's nation I'm proud to say that the first online tournament is upon us for all November patrons at

of the glorious details[Music]I just watched that clip of my client's side from worship troopers or it's even better than I remember it's they find this guy who has bighole in his head and there's clearly no brain in there Michael Ironside takes his like you know he has like a a metal arm and he takes two of his fingers that he sticks it into the hole and then he pulls hisfinger out and it's got all this goop on it and then he looks at like one of the kids and he goes they suck just brains out like it's just so good it's so good. God he's great man and under it underit's just a cinema well that's the lead in we're starting with that and it's time to now talk about the rest of our sardak nor how are we going to suck the brains out of our enemies intwilight and perium let's start with round one we go through the strategy cards and especially focus on round one and what's what's good but we'll kind ofextrapolate those things into the rest of the game so hunter card number one is leadership how do we feel? I don't like it but I'm not going to like a lot of this.The upside is you're like sort of helping your economy a little bit because you get an extra token so that's sort of an economic advantage.However, we don't really care about following a lot of command stuff early so I would probably take construction if I was last pick like ifDiplo is not available like maybe I would take that but yeah leadership I would not say is is very good what sucks about their round one is we kind of want one of the good ones right one ofthe three really good ones basically and if we don't get that then we're kind of obsessed which kind of makes this makes this very simple as far as explaining it to you the listener but it doesn't make it verysimple for like well what do I do if I don't get that is like well yeah you wait I guess I even kind of skipped ahead on your notes like what are what are our broad goals what are we trying to get out of our strategy cards and why why do weneed the the quote unquote good ones well we want to fix our economy and we were not going to fix it I guess is maybe not how she put it but we want to have a slightly better opening as far asthe game go and we want to unlock our commander as soon as possible and guess what even in best case scenario we don't get to do both of those things right we want we'll do one or the other we probably will will not do both in fact I can't think of anymaybe there's one situation I think of or we would do both in involves having a blue skip so let's talk about Diplo yeah Diplo is decent depending on the slide situation if we have a blue skip we want one really bad we're going to wantto skip and we would love some economic bumps and this can kind of give that hopefully of the right slice for it over although would not take this over the the triad of trade warfare and tech we are a warfarefaction around one is one of the ones that I like taking more I like to call that out because like lately people think I never like taking any time I say any preference I have people are like well that's howthere always is and it's like well there is no always in twilight in period sometimes you need to do it a different way because you're playing a different faction that's what it means right I am in fact capable of evaluating the game in front of me and making anew choice I just there's a difference between me saying you know I think people take warfare around one too much without thinking about the deeper implications of that right and you know realizing when you're playing afaction that actually really needs to take that and this is this would be a perfect example of that of why would you take warfare when if start X and you your game we haven't gotten to thereasons yet but like you know start I will take it yeah you don't need the secondary is really good for you you the only scary thing is no one taking it right all you have to do is identify thefactions that will always take it no matter what the ones that are better off taking it themselves and that's like five total factions maybe and sorry is one of them and we are we are definitely one ofthe politics is a low pick I was like you know a lot times I think I favor politics too much in general strategy and we I don't get it why you would take it asSardak we we will like never take custodians and your wildest dreams yeah I mean we will and if there's a unique case where maybe we could I understand Christmas isalways coming sure we don't we have no real business like planning to always take this if a tech objective comes out wemight need it to double tech if that's the like if you got to unit upgrades and two and two colors that's maybe the right thing to do right but I don't know even in thatsituation I'm a little bit hesitant although I also feel like if you get both the tech objectives to come out of it immediately in your game I think you just lost it was yeah I waswant to say it sounds like your argument really is if both the tech objectives come out yeah you could mitigate that you might have died though like you might as well just shut up and leave yeah or just play wildodd you know what I mean like just just crazy swing swing wildly and like don't care yeah instruction is like kind of move to mewe you have decent production at home we got we have a three resource home system planet five production combined with the agent and I think we're doing generallyokay as far as production goes yeah I don't think we need to rush for structures unless of course they're objectives but trade let's talk about tradeI would say it's not number one to have trade I think it will be your number two it's really helpful we need to build plastic and we have to follow tech we have to follow tech it's like the worst thing aboutSardak is that you you absolutely have to follow tech round one and if you do not I just don't get you can't you're going to come back from that right because round two feels likeround one yep when it comes to tech for Sardak door so if then you're saying round three is going to feel like round one now that's that's just our might have six technologies at the endaround one and you did if you don't follow you guys zero like you're that that's a crazy level of disparity in a game that has a techthrottle on it like that has has tech gates now I realize there are some people out there that play tech lists Sardakand that's cool and I salute you the we did not make this guide for you you are beyond the space cat these turtlessituation you're too smart you're just smart you you outsmarted us you outfoxed us you're too smart you're too cool yeah Foxy does there's no way around itwarfare that's pick unlock gamma round one yeah do it do it do it is my favorite open can you explain to me why we might wantround one because that could be like in a normal in a normal like aggressive faction guy we would talk about like you're not going to do that roundto like you're not going to utilize this mean ability right out the gate what is different about Sardak door.What's different is that we're desperate and projecting projecting that potential violence onto a neighbor is important to possibly get favorable deals to get them to work with you on objectivesto make it easier to get any objective the only objective that we will get easily our control objectives involving explicitly planets not even ones that don't involve planets right so like we have no advantage when it comes to like occupying systems that do not contain planetsnot at all we have our plus one and that's it we already told you the plus one's bogus yeah so plus one's not even good right so all we have is the fact that ournasty little bug boys can just kind of hop on the planet yes because the thing is to like the thing you got to remember about gamma mama is that it allows you to alsostall I think in a unique way most most factions when they when they come into a round and they think I want to do a little bit of violence want to have some of the old ultraviolence right they're going to send their ships right to go do stuff which means they have to sort of think of that is like if I move these ships early and I'm going to leave like a hole in my slice you don't do that right you can keep your ship setup in their gumformation and just send your bugs in also is always going to be times where they pass you know that where they have already passed and you're not unpassedand now you've got gamma and you could say hey I can send this in and I'm not even going to fight in space I'm just going to come take this planet and it's very likely that you're going to be able to project that now ideally you do not start orright so what the idea is being able to project this strength will hopefully give you a diplomatic advantage right and hopefully an economic one toothe simplest terms I could put it in is with warfare you can first off get to that equitistant system probably faster yeah only like super fast factions are just going to like first action take an equitistantor whatever but you can usually get there or or even if you're not first like with us more sizable force and you can just use this leverageand then I'm talking about of saying I'm keeping this I'm not actually going to move in on your slice but the threat will always be there I'm going to keep a strong fleet in this equitistant so don't get cute with me this one's mine and start I can just sort of like spreadthere might a little bit wider than another faction would be able to pull off yeah although I would push back on the idea of it being a fleet because most of the time it's going to be a carrier by itself right no fight ornot really but I should say force the ground forces themselves are the ground to to further swarming into to our opponents and we just kind of say like just let me have these two planets I need more money than you do because yourwell Joan are somebody else just let me take the equitistant and then the two of us can actually support swap and be a piece for the rest of the game.Yeah the last thing to really talk about when it comes around what strategy cards is technology I think it's a decent pick I don't like it as much straight do I think you should double tech if you can it will be nice yeah why not why not make me happy to do it if you can is a better than warfare no is a better than trade no yeah definitely notyeah if you're double-tacking you did an X minus one you turned your three commodities into two trade goods and you spent all of that cash on tech and you built no units around one so that's your that's your cost but you you completely fix your check game you are caught up to everybody or most everybodyand you can restart the game in round two and say we got build we got build units this round big time yeah I I would say it's it's it's not the worst thing to do to not build any ships the start at ground one just because we're in such a desperate situation that I feel like it's like I survivedI've sure stuff like that but well yeah I mean it's it's not it's not nice I prefer the versatility of a little bit of ships a little bit of tech but what I think what's nice about this double tech we don't talk about this often because usually it's just like it's not worth it to double tech the two tech startacro going to get if they double tech are so incredibly beneficial to their game and a and beneficial immediately like they will help you in round to get stuff done and that's not always the cat like some factions like start with a blue tech and if I double tech I'm going to get gravity drive and then I'm likegonna get something else that is just sort of right extra but for start at gets like no no I'm getting DET and gravity driver whatever like both of these things are immediately applicableso let's talk about the tech path so we can kind of get a better sense of like what is it we're rushing for what are we trying to get here yeah so the core tech are gravity drive carrierto and then I'm saying the supplements are core tech okay which is sort of my way of saying there are no core tech but it's definitely gravity drivingcarrier to and then you need some of the other stuff right some combination you absolutely what you're saying is you need gravity drive and carrier to and that's notenough to win the game right you need you need those to for sure and then you need even more than that right and I want that more than that to remain sort of ambiguousyeah let's talk no skip style this I one thing I want to spell out up top is that start ignore in my opinion is the most DET reliant action in the game funny evenmore so than in period because if you took away DET in period would still have a lot of very good advantages that would make them one of the betterfactions in the game start ignore desperately needs DET because they got a gamble if they want to win the seventh player has got to come in on their behalf and help them out a little bitand that's your way of doing that it is the easiest way to get started to just go right for it you have a cruiser at home that is ready to explore the finalfrontier okay these are the voyages okay though these mommy boys of Neil Patrick Stewart yes yes and as far as like fighting goes let's talk no skip path DET oranti mass which I prefer DET don't start in a slice with asteroid fields try your best not to I am in one right now and I hate it so bad dude having to get another tech as Sardak is the worst yeahwe got gravity drive we got carrier to sling relay and then I'm going to throw lightweight in there and hopefully I don't know that's that's plenty of tech right there we will definitely I'll talk about other things you can get in other tech pass that you can throw in here if youget more tech yeah but I'm just going to call this your standard yeah Sardak nor overwhelm them with carriers and fighters and infantry and enable that hero to do maximum damage with lightweight yeah and then sling the clothes gaps on production because I production at home isn't enough to get you through the whole game but with sling relay it definitely isespecially using sling relay to produce a capital ship and then whenever we produce normally you're doing a capital ship plus two fighters to infantry and the agent giving us an additional to infantry that's going to be enough fodder and I'm like it us through just barely probably right but yeah what we really want is to be able to send those those carriers wherever we want in like round four round five one and if we're if we're on a standard path I mean we have to research round one to Hunters Pointlightweight we get in round five if we're getting one tech around this is five tech right this is the absolute limit like that this is the top floor of what is maybe possible to accomplish if you miss around a tech you're in in real trouble because you don't get lightweight and suddenly your toolkit has no win slight has nothing nothing else no extra bag of tricks you do have three movement carriers that at least is good you might get a couple things done but lightweight changes like so much about what you can accomplish yeahyeah and then I got something kind of weird for blue blue yeah I'm going to skip a surprising tech here we're going to open with DET we're going to skip to carrier to then sling relay lightweight and I want to end this one will flea log I actually do think you can make just carrier to happen I think two movement is enough if you plan right I think that gravity drive is a good supplement and we definitely need it in the no skip path just because it makes sense to pick it up on theway yeah gravity driver last is to throw in something like a single dread not into it or our flagship God forbid which I don't know why you're building the flagship but whatever maybe you have too much money I don't knowI don't know has that ever happened I'm not sure but we got to do D T I really want to throw this down that you are it you got to do D T so many times D T was the thing that helps my economy stay intact and I normally would never be like ohwhat you should do is just draw cards and pray but that's what you have to do a start act you just have to draw cards and be like yeah well hopefully it goes okay it makes it kind of interesting to me I want to connect something that you werejust saying we don't ever build our flags do we ever have too much money my guess here hunter is you're like your multi draft preferences if we need D Tand our units do okay it sounds to me we we really are a bit reliant on like a decent influence like we've no influence at home but we we need to get the high influence slices so that we can get the tokens to affordthis extra stuff and we can assume will have enough resources and trade goods to afford a relevant fleet like we will build just enough units to get by we do not need to go crazy on it this isn't like myguide where all I said for an hour and a half was build as many units as physically possible and hope that that's enough this isn't that right this is you build arelevant fleet it will stay relevant you got to get that extra stuff there's there's all the extra things you need to acquire and so to me it feels like there's a focus on we needwe need command counters because we got to go do the D E T and that can't cost us some factions I can't go D E T and I don't have I don't have the extraand it's like I can't just spend command tokens on that that's part of what makes imperial great is it never costs you anything right to go do thatexploring so yeah I think command counters are also like a pretty important aspect of our our kit.Definitely and the fact that we prioritize the cheaper units with a carrier being like the most expensive unit I'm recommending you get reallyyou know then I think I think that just speaks more and more to that like we're going to win with the with the with the crappy stuff we're going to win with the little guys basically and that themat a clay makes sense. Let's talk green skip path this is I don't I shouldn't even didn't even talk about this.To me it's the same path as the no skip path but you could add fighter to and biosims it for some reason I want to throw this out here only if you have extratext like I still think you should get all of those other tech before including definitely lightweight let's remember light wave moreso then with even other factions light wave is always very important but with with with Sardak nor that's going to be how you use the hero if you don't get light wave I a lot of times you're not going to get to use that hero because the hero has this problem of you have to get the dang ships there yeah and you're not good at that you have noadvantages to that and a lot of times you can't do it so lightweight you really really need it yeah green skip path maybe you throw in fighter to and biosims but also maybe just don't worry about it don't if you have the bonus tech early in thegame it seems like you should just get yourself to your lightweight position faster and then stop spending tokens on tech and stop like like around four and five reinvest that money in other such as that now build a couple more defensethat like build that extra dread at home or whatever like sling the dread at home whatever it might be I do like fighter to though because that is that will feel that that plus one on top of ourone in a way that I feel like other factions would not feel it and then also biosims sling relay is important because we have no stall really so like that would be our only way to get that kind of stuffthat's how we get to fighters hitting on a two we forgot fighter to I knew we forgot something earlier yeah we we didn't add in fighter to into the mix that's how we get our stuff to hit on a two so the only thing that misses one on a one okayso this is probably the flashiest tech path we could do DET into gravity drive into carrier to and then skip to XO2's and then lightweight with this one we're we're going to or go sling relay but with the added functionality of XO2's I feel like it's actually worth it.This isn't you know this is not a whole lot of tech this is like a doable amount of tech is we're keeping it to five right but man this is punchy in the late game this is like what this is really what I would like to see yeah obviously something something that I've completely left out is in this yellow skip path you also need toabout to say I was going to say well we just get lightweight so we do have to get there but so I guess that's what I mean is the only way I'm letting you get away with this yellow skip thing is if you also have a blue skip so I should say yellow skip plus blue skip is the path because we got a skip from grab drive to lightweight and if you don't have a blue skip in addition to your yellow skip I'm not going to let you do this you got to do the no skip path or you get the bonus tech right if you get if you get around to around three agenda face tech or whatever that's likeyou throw in the fleet logistics and then you can get to lightweight like you've bought yourself the round five lightweight in almost every situation though in all of these tech paths you're getting lightweight round five I mean it is very hard to get lightweight toreflectors in round four you are hedging and and here's the problem how often is tech in round five not all that a lot of times so we're we are talking about a faction that genuinely requires the bonus tech to hit for us to be able to use our tool kit and the way we want.I mean but you are okay so we haven't gotten to talking about points yet you're not good at them I think it's obvious from how we're talking about it you're not good at them so you don't worry about things like speaker control meaning that you are going to take tech and double tech hopefully every single game you will get at least one opportunity to do that and DEC might get you at least oneon that device like there is room maybe this bonus tech in there so yeah there's there's there's a world where you get ahead of that one tech per round cycle but you kind of need it you have to foot that's what you're focusing on I like making that point here like don't you know how to speak your stuff you're doing tech stuff because you got it you got to get to this like critical mass.And then we'll talk red skip path oh wait no let's not it doesn't change anything it just really doesn't you all there's just nothing that I can throw in because of a red skip that I feel like is necessary because of a red skip I think if you're trying to make red skip work you're working way too hard just lean into what you got okay we don't we can't get that much tech we start with nothing.Reds well I just couldn't come up with anything yeah a lot of people like to throw AI dev at a start ignore I do not think that it is useful it is maybe a special case tech that I only feel like makes sense if we need a third unit upgrade just if that happens most games I would rather stay focused on these essential text yeah well you don't know in time you don't know if you need a third unit of great until round five.And then I have to like it's just it's not a thing worth hedging on like I'm not gonna get a I dev in round one because maybe three unit upgrades will come up in round five right that's right just doesn't make any sense yeah it's the kind of thing to where it's like it's it's supposed to be the cheeky way to get yourself to XO try room to without having to go down yellow.And I think early days it was like with the red skip you can throw in Valca reparticle weave after this but I think it's reliant on even more tech that you just don't have time for.Yeah and we already talked about how Valca reparticle weave is a win more.Yeah that's just like you do not need to be researching that like blindly you know like it's just not that kind of thing and yeah so I just think I think no red I think we go blue primarily with skips and that's basically the path.And it's a bummer it's not cool it's not interesting but it's like I just I just I've never seen anything else like kind of sing for them besides that.Yeah so I mean I think it's I think it's just the only way to go.I will say I do want to reiterate we are DT faction we desperately need to find good cards and bonus points in order to pull off a win.I think it's a worthwhile investment in almost every game and it's put me into a vial possible viable position so many times when normally I would not be.So do that.Yeah do get DT.Yeah I feel like the lesson over the course of all of these super guides and our journey with POK is realizing that DET is maybe actually the best tech in the game.It is probably the most important technology in the entire game we talk a lot about gravity drive we talk a lot about blue tech in general but like the actual one that's like winning games is DET.DET is crazy.Also DET is helpful for us because with our lack of fighter start we're bad at retreats DET gives you a little bit more versatility when it comes to retreating which helps you save your ships a little bit longer.Because people are going to destroy our ships that happens because you send a carrier out there with no fighters and then you just got your it's somebody is going to eventually be like you know what I might not take your planets but I am going to destroy that ship right there and then there you go.Yeah Saturn engine versus a single Sardat carrier is kind of a no brainer huh or space cannon.I'm just literally a pop shot deep space like a Jol-n-R neighbor you moving in yeah is just suddenly impossible now because that one space cannon shot right is to actually because a plasma scoring and with re-rolls you know well it's ridiculous thank goodness hunter we are a battle gods we are extortion masters so we're probably making bank in the tradingwe're just going to hold all of our neighbors over a barrel and they're going to pay us endlessly to fuel our thirst for blood right not really bro what are you talking about you crazy you being crazy right now it's a what we are three commodity faction middleing promise for another people don't I think people don't even like it at all.And I think that I think that you know so and I feel like I've said this like I remember saying this last time we did this guy like I remember saying exactly this and it still hasn't you know happen but you got to advertise this thing you got to put it out there I got tech lar tech lar is a thing like like throw it out there take it out of your hand in TTS or TTPG but in your player area area and then write something's being like you can buy this OK if you have a difficult ground combat I got you if you want to ensure a close ground combat.I got you right here come on dude you got to do it and then just see and don't be like oh my god here's here's one where I will definitely stay my ground and be like dude if you are haggling about tech lar like just sell it bro like they have a dollar take the dollar you know don't try to be getting like just make the sale because you're generally not selling anything so please you got to the commander is helpful it's useful.Like people should want it it should be worth something yeah a lot of times it just isn't people don't plan for it right so that's another one you got to get that people's ear you got to let people know like dude you could havehave you could basically have what is a a on the sheet level faction ability yeah if you just played your cards right you know I think heightens should want it most the time I feel like people only talk aboutabout Gomssecus as an alliance in the craziest weather they're only like our bracket in huh that's nuts and it's like soul would be a mate like soul what could you all kinds of work with that like you said Titans is incredible like there's so many good examples of plenty of factions that havethe advantages to getting this like that that would would like to have this and you just don't see them handed around often enough any faction with a decentmech ability would like this nozroca would love it impure even would like it because it allows you to get the mech into like weird places thatmaybe it wouldn't get too normally and then that when that mech is there you can be like I can sabotage you I wish transit diodes was a more popular tech I'vereally liked it but it is it's just like so deep in yellow that it's pretty hard to do much but like yellow factions like men tack there's always a little world where I'm like if Iget bonus tech I could get like a transit diodes that be pretty cool right have that and like anybody who's got transit diodes would do cool stuff withGomssecus like the idea of warping stuff closer and then sending it directly into the combat is very cool so yeah you're kind of nailing it rightsometimes the problem is that even if someone had gamma mama they didn't space their infantry out all game in such a way as to make it like viable right so that is that is a fair that'salmost a critique really is like how do you buy gamma mama if you didn't plan for gamma mama you know and startagnore has the agent that's putting infantry on the front lines as well like like like start is designed to use gamma mama andkind of basically nobody else is I mean what a nomad with their their agent and it's not adding it's just like moving to close theirlike there's a tiny argument for that and it's not particularly convincing although nomads another good one though because with transit diodes and like movingmechs around and then using those mechs as warp zones for your flagships like you can do pretty silly final round stuff isnomad if you if you had access to this computer yeah yeah and that's also why I was come back to titans though because titans they're always going to have more and more ground forces there sadly you can't you can't move the dangpds wouldn't that be cool right if they could jump over with gamma mama but you know there's still they still should be throwing mechs and infantry down on the front lines in a waythat should maybe work out for gamma maybe you got to go so far as to like actually look at what players could do business with it you know maybethat you got to go that far in order to do it I mean start to say early is the main thing I'm hearing start talking to someone early and make that likeround one figure out who's probably going to be the person you should sell it to and get them on board so they can start thinking I'm going to havethem second by around three so what how can I facilitate my game to be ready for gomsecus to be in play for me yeah and I'm not sure why they do that maybe they do that I don't know it's easier way to make so you can'tjust you can't show up in round three and being like who wants gomsecus because everyone's going to be like dude I'm not it is it's seven 30 in the morning I'm not ready for gomsecus this is too crazy I can't start with gomsecuslet's wait till later but let's close it up let's let's conclude this one so victory points wise I don't want to miss words weren't bad at the objectives were bad basically all of them except for control objectives that specifically involved playnets which isn't even that many of them yep we have a win slay and that's cool but we are not a front runner so we what why are why do we have a win slay ability even so I would say this you'regoing to play a start ignore what what is successful calculated specific violence is successful the threat in projection of violence is even better so there's like actual violence that can be usefulprojection of violence more useful right way better right and then there's the lottery okay and these are like I'm talking gamblinggambling so gamble play the game like you don't have any investment in whether you win or lose yeah that's how I would encourage you to play basically any that's why I love playing low to yourfactions is because I I open my third eye a little bit and just embrace possibility because when you're playing from behind there's no you you should you should bet on you should betit's an odd thing about gambling that the the worst you're doing in life the more you should just put it all on red and just spin the wheel you know like what what you got to lose you know yeah there'ssomething to what I don't have like really great like advice for a Sardak mil tea draft like in our tournament but I have seen the good versions of it and it's always the persongoes slice first and it's a planet rich slice it's it's a bunch of planets and then when it comes back around you take a speaker order and the really tricky funny thing is you take a speakerorder not because it's high in the order let's say you just like assume you can't get one or two so you're like well I'm not getting tech and I'm not getting a warfaretrader like I'm not getting the thing that I want let me just make sure I'm putting my slice next to another planetrich slice like whoever else also took some planets because what you want we always call it a land bridge you want and you want to you want a path of planets with noplanet less systems that get away you want you want that either between you and a neighbor or on your way to mechotelor just like a nice little patch it's the most delightful Sardak area is where there's just like five tiles all next to each other that are just allplanets and it's like cool I live there I'm going to be able to do that and then Sardak is like a last pick faction so it comes back around and you end up getting to be Sardak in pretty goodslice with lots of planets with like a relatively okay speaker order in between slices you like.And it totally though Matt yeah that's pretty hard to get yeah that's pretty it's pretty hard to make all of those things work at once.But yeah if you can't get a land bridge get a land bridge if you can't just get planets I mean I would say that even more basic take of what you're saying is there better be five planets right near you you know yeah you can't do thethe tiles the slices hunter and I always put into like especially later on drafts where it's like the empty beta is right in front of your home system not a Sardak slice not at all not even a little bit yeah well guess what there's not really much ofthere's no such thing is a Sardak slice actually almost like yeah I mean there's the ones where you got three planets system right in the center of your home of your slice that's pretty cool a lot of times that I'm going to havea multi won't give you that you know I mean like it's it's you want such a specific thing that a lot of times I didn't come up Sardak likes theRiggles I'll say that much green skip influence three planets. It's like the only tile in the game that that that Sardak is like cool I have this but beyond that it's yeah just like have as many planets as you can yeah justjust have planets just have them as many as you can get just get them you know I want to thank our weird bear squeamishy move cabal so cool and Darryl Drake withArnold mr. Brister Alice and Lachewski Absel R.Y. is tangen Nash and I want to thank my baby child big friends Jadim Jedi and Vince you can rate this podcast wherever you listen to it you can on podcast addict you can like give a thumbs up now perepisode no idea if that does anything let's all assume the algorithm gods are always watching everything you do give us a thumbs up on podcast addict what do you say just do it okay let's see where we end up let's see if this this turns any where young flame you can send us thisup here in life stories space cat's peace turtles a gmail dot com that's where we read out stories we haven't done it in like a little while but that's always kind of this works it's like a once a year if even thatkind of episode but send them I haven't we we've received a couple in the last few months and we'll take some more we have a baby of tournament updates for you wegot a list here that I'd love to read out hundreds done a lot of talk in this episode is my turn to run run the shiphere's some tournament winners for you game 135 a five player game congratulations to be as the window in yellow slice because it has hopes and in game36 which was one thirty six which is a six player game Leo B one is a star of tribes in the Vela Cilorxinburg in one thirty eight which was a buy thethe official best men tack player this is a couple checkmate yeah yeah I got you humble checkmate found a buy into the prelimscongratulations in one thirty nine the six player game was one by Ronnie Bimbo the as the bear near that in yellow slice because it has hopes and in one fortytwo a four player game blue fire one is the a sorrow tribes and gravity's due to blue fire is in a game with me in a sync right now so congratulations to blue fireon your win in one forty three six player game one by frauds as the impurion in a rigley field where the girls go out in a four player game one fortyfour else Selks else else else I like I like Elk Selks even though I know that's not what it is but I've always said Elks Selks the university ofJolinar's in devil went back down to Valor because you forgot something in game one forty five we had and cat find a buy this was another one of thoseclassic I think the humble one was as well which was a rules quiz by is I think what we should now start calling it it was a rulesquiz by and then for an cat they got a buy because in game one forty six patty horse play their rules quiz partner one as the necker virus in devil went back down toVelon because he forgot something in game one forty eight a five player game official day the count one is the council clairs men tack in devil went back down toVelon or because he forgot I can't there's so long why we make them so long in game one fifty another buy for shimmy I did want to know this this just happened like yesterdayso it's not on these notes yet but I I just want to toss it in and maybe we'll repeat it last week but it was a fun thing to say we had a winjust the basics one as council clairs extra and it is in fact the first win for extra clairs in a tournament game in anand I know clairs extra has never won until now that's a fun little staff for everybody that's a tournament updates we did itthank you to Kraken or providing us with the tournament updates you are you are such a doll and we appreciate the work that you do for thiscommunity home brews guild let's talk so I asked if there was a way to fix the proposed to con hero which basically allowedthe hacon to choose everyone's strategy cards with completely wild is too much and and cat chimed in most people did not chime in I will know mostpeople did not suggest anything and cat chimed him to say could fix the hacon hero if they had to spend ten trade goods to use itand I just want to say no that is not that's too easy actually that's pretty is pretty easy. However he goes on to say a whole set of alternate heroes with alternate unlocks would be interesting could be one of those fancyand scenario things each player replaces their hero with their superhero card that corresponds to that faction these hero cards have unique unlock conditions I do like unique unlock conditions for heroesand I do think it will be fun but it looks like nobody wants to decide what a hacon hero would be or the council clairs do we have anything we have anything for we have something a rough draft we could come up with right nowthat we can then throw the home burs absolutely let's first talk about the fact that hacon has actually become it's it's going further and further into the bottom tier like hacon has been having a bad couple of yearsyeah and we talk a lot about the home system that their their current hero is feasibly a way to protect their home system it's like all the ton of ships and then just like nobody will come at it unless it's like today's episode sorrysorry I just wins just sorry I'm done it sorry I quit the period so I think we want a hero I think the hero build is stupid that that hacon I'll talk about collairesI want to be a con but it's not that but yeah it is notable that a collaires a con would have the hacon home system so they would in fact still have the same downside yes and so we don't have this build that we're talking about what is the thing that would help the the collairesto con protect their home system against would be invaders but if they could buy with money with trade goods right other players command tokens that they could place in their homes around like in around five you pop it and you just like it's like another diplomacy I like that that's fitting with the councilyou're saying we are the council but we we have this weird we opted like we've we've paid everybody off to leave us alone yes we bought somehow access to your command to your reinforcements bag right that we're now going to use to place tokensand I don't think they should be able to do it with everybody is sort of a signal jamming that cost money yeah what do I think it should be money or action cards that's my takeyeah you're still a commander and you you like maybe you're you you've got this funny like search for component action cards thing you don't have that like what the man tech here is on the table we're not gaining extras but you can spend like three bucks or an action card per player to make them place a command because you rarely have to hit everybody anyways there's like two people you're worried about win slaying you in any given game I've got it so at the end of the agenda phase in speaker orderand you purge the card you start with speaker you pay three trade goods or an action card you can place a man token from their reinforcements anywhere anywhere where you have ships yes units and you units units yeah let's do units anywhere you have unitsand you can continue doing that but you have to choose a new system but I don't know how we want to word that and you go around speaker order until you've done everybody or until you stop so it could be the type of thing where wow the player I really want to do this with that I want to do it on the home system they're last speaker order that means it's going to cost me a lot of money basicallyI like the idea of it being speaker order and also agenda phase because in I feel like there's an agenda lean on calares that needs to be preserved yeah they are meant to be sort of a fight agenda phase type I think all of the calares if we're reducing calares heroes they should all be agenda phase abilities that should just be the limitation is that the council does stuff when the council convenes when the galactic council convenes the council calares can pull stuff off and so you know that that's afunny timing window to because it is this like right before we pick pick strategy cards so people can adjust their strategies slightly based on whatever you choose to do but like we're like they should be potent abilities because everybody has time to respond so yeah I like to keep this a little bit cheap even then because it's so specifically happening I mean it's like it could be a buck or an action card but like you say you have to like do it to everybody in order to get to like the ones that really matter maybe some version of that makes you let'ssplit the difference let's say it's to do trade goods or one action card yeah yeah cool I like it we just do this every week now we have a new calares hero we're gonna like pop off every week I love it yeah yeah because we're gonna build our own space cast be startles calares themed pack of heroes and because I think I thinkshould have I think every viable faction basically should be an option although I want to draw some people are like I'll do anything is like I want to draw the line and be like the ones that make no sense we should not do like to ball Ican do my mind grow yeah yeah yeah not really logical conclusion yeah doesn't make sense they can get a different will make up a new faction that's like the anti-council and they're like the the axis of what would be allies the axis calaresyeah that sounds really fun yeah that would that would be fun to we're just gonna work on you and I will go full one like it it we're gonna come all the way back to we start a playing ti because we wanted anaccess and allies game where you didn't have to stay on the same team right and and that's how we found ti and we're gonna bring we're gonna hometo ti all the way back to two teams yeah and that's become novel again we should do an access and allies by light and period fusion board where it's the access and allies boardthat's earth but the factions are not instead of the you know said I will sense I don't know why I was like I didn't want to say the word Nazibut you could still say that mean the Irish sorry the Irish are replaced with the bear any of let me know and you know so on and so forth so I'll go one step further and say it should be thedoon map I mean technically we have the wrecks map like we could just but the right map isn't a real it's a dumb map of not lines but the do I want alternate historyworld war two with the twilight and period faction that's what would what would the United States be in that what do you think I mean the federation a soul right no that it can bethat because they're all people like what why do you say the what in the mind of the American you know what I mean like in thein the from the viewpoint I think it fits I'm not kidding in the way the Americans see themselves in the world yeah they're the only humanUnited States gets to be people yeah but the other the other countries you know they get to be not people yeah and Zach is themeant act we know that you know this I think that makes sense yeah yeah just how it works I don't know what it is what is Italy Italyinvented fascism they're they're proto bear any you know what is what is it I mean I think I think Italy in a way is thehacan just because they're cute you know I think they've got the Mediterranean trade routes oh yeah yeah I watch a lot ofshlokie Italian movies so I feel like I feel like saying they're cute is like that's a real like compliment for me to have seen butthey really are like I watch all these movies where it'll be like look at these beautiful Italian people and they're wearing tight blackgloves and adding each other is kind of what's going on but they sucked the brains out you knowthank you for listening to
