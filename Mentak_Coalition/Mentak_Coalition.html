<h2 id="i.-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>The Mentak Coalition are TI4’s pirate faction that steal trade goods
via Pillage and ambush opponents with pre-combat hits through Ambush.
They excel at economic theft from wealthy neighbors and leverage
cruiser-heavy fleets for sustained aggression. Mentak rewards
positioning near high-commodity factions, understanding when to Pillage
versus avoid conflict, and building cruiser swarms for Ambush and
Commander synergies.</p>
<p>The payoff? Being a potentially rich bitch leveraging your mobility
and faction tech. Steal opponent economies through Pillage, strike with
pre-combat Ambush hits, and extract promissory notes via Commander after
every space combat victory.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-playstyle">II. Playstyle</h2>
<p>Playing Mentak Coalition is like being a opportunistic corsair—you
position near wealthy trade routes and extract value from every passing
transaction. Your Pillage steals TGs whenever neighbors gain 3+ (passive
income all game), your Ambush fires cruiser/destroyer shots before
combat begins (free hits), and your cruiser-focused fleet leverages
these abilities for economic and military dominance. You’re not trying
to win through traditional economy—you’re winning through theft, ambush
tactics, and leveraging your 2-tech starting advantage.</p>
<p>The key strength of Mentak is economic parasitism. Normal factions
build economies through planets and trade. You steal economies through
Pillage—every neighbor transaction, every Trade refresh, every deal
generates TGs for you automatically. Over a game, Pillage generates
15-25 free TGs (around 2 Trade strategy cards worth of value) just from
sitting next to wealthy factions.</p>
<p>Opponents will try to minimize Pillage by spending TGs before hitting
3, trading Promise of Protection for immunity, or avoiding your borders.
That moment when you’ve Pillaged 20+ TGs by R5, ambushed fleets with
pre-combat cruiser hits, and extracted 4 promissory notes via Commander?
Pure pirate efficiency.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iii.-the-basics">III. The Basics</h2>
<h3 id="a.-home-system-commodities">A. Home System &amp;
Commodities</h3>
<p><strong>Home System:</strong> - <strong>Moll Primus:</strong> 4
resources / 1 influence - <strong>Total: 4 resources / 1 influence (4
optimal resources / 1 optimal influence)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commodities:</strong> 2</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Single-planet home with 4 resources and only
1 influence. The 4 resources fund military production (excellent for
building cruiser swarms), but 1 influence is terrible for politics and
influence objectives. Single-planet home is easier to defend than
multi-planet systems. Low commodity count (2) is below average—you gain
more from Pillaging opponents than refreshing your own commodities.</p>
<h3 id="b.-starting-fleet">B. Starting Fleet</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 Carrier</li>
<li>2 Cruisers</li>
<li>3 Fighters</li>
<li>4 Infantry</li>
<li>1 Space Dock</li>
<li>1 PDS</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Problematic starting situation due to lack of
carry capacity. You have 4 infantry but only 1 carrier with capacity
4—your 2 cruisers have no capacity. You’ll need to build more carriers
early for expansion.</p>
<h3 id="c.-starting-technologies">C. Starting Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Sarween Tools (Yellow)</strong> - When you use PRODUCTION,
reduce the combined cost of produced units by 1.</p>
<p><strong>Plasma Scoring (Red)</strong> - When 1 or more of your units
use BOMBARDMENT or SPACE CANNON, 1 of those units may roll 1 additional
die.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Good for defense and economy early game, but
not much else.</p>
<h3 id="d.-faction-abilities">D. Faction Abilities</h3>
<p><strong>Ambush (Faction Ability):</strong> At the start of a space
combat, you may roll 1 die for each of up to 2 of your cruisers or
destroyers in the system. For each result equal to or greater than that
ship’s combat value, produce 1 hit; your opponent must assign it to 1 of
their ships.</p>
<p>Pre-combat hit ability. Before combat dice are rolled, choose up to 2
cruisers/destroyers in the system. Roll 1 die per ship. If result ≥ that
ship’s combat value, deal 1 hit to opponent (they must assign to a
ship). Cruiser I has Combat 7, Destroyer I has Combat 9—so you need 7+
or 9+ to hit. After upgrading to Cruiser II (Combat 6), your ambush hits
on 6+. This is free damage before combat even begins.</p>
<p><strong>Pillage (Faction Ability):</strong> After 1 of your neighbors
gains trade goods or resolves a transaction, if they have 3 or more
trade goods, you may take 1 of their trade goods or commodities.</p>
<p>Passive theft ability. After a NEIGHBOR (adjacent player) gains TGs
or resolves a transaction (trade goods, action card effects, strategy
cards, etc.), if they now have 3+ TGs, you may steal 1 TG or 1 commodity
from them. This triggers passively—you don’t spend actions, it just
happens whenever conditions are met.</p>
<p><strong>Triggers:</strong> - Neighbor refreshes commodities via Trade
strategy (gains TGs → you Pillage 1) - Neighbor receives transaction
from another player (gains TGs → you Pillage 1) - Neighbor activates
ability that grants TGs (you Pillage 1)</p>
<p><strong>Key Limitation:</strong> Only works on NEIGHBORS (players
adjacent on the map). Position yourself to neighbor wealthy
factions.</p>
<h3 id="e.-leaders">E. Leaders</h3>
<p><strong>Agent - Suffi An:</strong></p>
<p>After the Pillage faction ability is used against another player: You
may exhaust this card; if you do, you and that player each draw 1 action
card.</p>
<p>Pillage reward agent. After you Pillage an opponent (not yourself),
exhaust agent: both you and Pillaged player draw 1 action card. Good
diplomatic tool—softens the blow of Pillage (they get action card
compensation) while giving you extra cards.</p>
<p><strong>Commander - S’ula Mentarion:</strong> <em>Unlock: Have 4
cruisers on the game board.</em></p>
<p>After you win a space combat: You may force your opponent to give you
1 promissory note from their hand.</p>
<p>Promissory extraction commander. After unlocking, every space combat
victory lets you FORCE opponent to give you 1 promissory note from their
hand. Over a game, you can make some sneaky plays for PN notes.</p>
<p><strong>Hero - Ipswitch, Loose Cannon:</strong> <em>Unlock: Have 3
scored objectives.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sleeper Cell - At the start of a space combat that you are
participating in:</strong> You may purge this card; if you do, for each
other player’s ship that is destroyed during this combat, place 1 ship
of that type from your reinforcements in the active system.</p>
<p>Ship replication hero. At start of a space combat: purge hero card.
For EACH enemy ship destroyed during the combat, place 1 matching ship
from your reinforcements in the system. Can be almost impossible to
beat—you convert enemy losses into your gains, potentially doubling your
fleet mid-combat.</p>
<h3 id="f.-promissory-note---promise-of-protection">F. Promissory Note -
<strong>Promise of Protection</strong></h3>
<p>ACTION: Place this card faceup in your play area. While this card is
in your play area, the Mentak player cannot use their Pillage faction
ability against you. If you activate a system that contains 1 or more of
the Mentak player’s units, return this card to the Mentak player.</p>
<p>Pillage immunity. Give a player immunity from your Pillage as long as
they don’t activate systems with your units.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Usage:</strong> - <strong>Round 1-2 (R1-R2):
Extract a good deal for your PN.</strong> Find a neighbor that won’t
generate many TGs (low commodities, poor economy) but still wants to pay
for your PN. Get value from a neighbor you wouldn’t be pillaging much
anyway. - <strong>Example:</strong> Trade PN to Sardakk/Arborec/Last
Bastion for alliance or support for throne. They have low commodity
counts so you’d barely pillage them, but they still fear Pillage and
will pay for immunity. - <strong>Better use:</strong> Befriend
aggressive neighbors to let you focus on pirate things elsewhere. - If
you can’t pillage your best target, the value must be very solid before
giving up that Pillage income.</p>
<p>Trade value: HIGH for wealthy factions (3-4 TG equivalent or
alliance).</p>
<h3 id="g.-alliance">G. Alliance</h3>
<p><strong>Alliance Ability:</strong> <em>While the Mentak player’s
commander is unlocked:</em> <em>After you win a space combat, you may
force your opponent to give you 1 promissory note from their
hand.</em></p>
<p>Very valuable alliance—depends on how rich the faction that gets it
can be. Extract promissory notes from combat victories just like
Mentak’s Commander. Trade value: 3-4 TG.</p>
<h3 id="h.-mech---moll-terminus">H. Mech - <strong>Moll
Terminus</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | <strong>Sustain Damage</strong></p>
<p><strong>Special Ability:</strong> Other players’ ground forces on
this planet cannot use Sustain Damage.</p>
<p>Sustain denial mech (ground version of your flagship). Enemy mechs
and infantry on the same planet cannot use Sustain Damage. Place on
contested planets during invasions to deny opponent ground force
Sustain. Combined with bombardment, this shreds opponent ground
defenses.</p>
<h3 id="i.-flagship---fourth-moon">I. Flagship - <strong>Fourth
Moon</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 8 | Combat: 7 (x2) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 3 | <strong>Sustain
Damage</strong></p>
<p><strong>Special Ability:</strong> Other players’ ships in this system
cannot use SUSTAIN DAMAGE.</p>
<p>Sustain denial flagship. All enemy ships in the system cannot use
Sustain Damage. Can be a counter to dreadnought-heavy factions, but can
also have low amount of impact depending on opponent fleet composition.
Combined with Ambush (pre-combat hits), it can delete opponent capital
ships before they can respond.</p>
<h3 id="j.-faction-technologies">J. Faction Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Mirror Computing (Yellow/Yellow/Yellow)</strong> - When you
spend trade goods, each trade good is worth 2 resources or influence
instead of 1.</p>
<p>Triple-yellow tech. TGs are worth 2 resources or 2 influence each
instead of 1. If you have 5 TGs, you can spend them as 10 resources or
10 influence. This is massive value for Pillage-based economy—stolen TGs
become 2x value. The 3 yellow prerequisite is steep (Sarween Tools →
Neural Motivator/Graviton → Mirror Computing), but if you Pillage
heavily, it’s worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Salvage Operations (Yellow/Yellow)</strong> - After you win
or lose a space combat, gain 1 trade good; if you won the combat, you
may also produce 1 ship in that system of any ship type that was
destroyed during the combat.</p>
<p>Double-yellow tech. After ANY space combat (win or lose), gain 1 TG.
If you WON, also produce 1 ship matching any type destroyed during
combat (free production). If 3 cruisers died (yours or theirs), produce
1 cruiser for free. Over 5-7 combats per game, this generates 5-7 TGs +
5-7 free ships. Excellent value for aggressive playstyle.</p>
<h3 id="k.-slice-and-draft-considerations">K. Slice and Draft
Considerations</h3>
<p><strong>Speaker Order:</strong> - <strong>Mentak is too weak to not
have a solid position</strong> - You need good slice and neighbor
positioning - <strong>Probably required to pick low priority card to
save your early game</strong> - You may have to draft early to secure
proper setup, even if it means lower faction priority - <strong>Position
near rich neighbors</strong> - Critical for Pillage. Lobby to sit next
to Hacan, Empyrean, Jol-Nar, Deepwrought</p>
<p><strong>Slice Priorities:</strong> - <strong>Prioritize a strong
system nearby if you can’t get multiple carriers</strong> - Move 1
carriers limit expansion - <strong>Access to wormholes or other
players</strong> - You need wormhole access to reach other players for
Pillage positioning and expansion - <strong>Entropic Scar is
beast</strong> - Your faction techs (Mirror Computing, Salvage
Operations) are super strong - <strong>Focus on high optimals</strong> -
You’re flexible with slices since you’ll have lots of TG from Pillage -
<strong>Influence planets</strong> - You have 1 influence at home, need
influence-heavy planets to balance</p>
<p><strong>Slice Features to Avoid:</strong> - <strong>Isolated slices
with no wormholes</strong> - Can’t access other players easily with Move
1 carriers, limits Pillage opportunities - <strong>Low influence
slices</strong> - You already have only 1 influence at home, can’t
afford more resource-heavy planets</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Mentak needs wormhole access or proximity
to other players for Pillage positioning. Entropic Scar is beast.
Influence planets help balance your weak home influence. Avoid
isolation.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Note:</strong> Position near wealthy neighbors
(Hacan, Xxcha, Jol-Nar) during draft to maximize Pillage value. Your
weak starting fleet (Move 1 carrier) requires wormhole access or close
proximity to other players.</p>
<h3 id="l.-breakthrough-technology">L. Breakthrough Technology</h3>
<p><strong>The Table’s Grace (Yellow&lt;&gt;Green)</strong> - If you
have the Cruiser II unit upgrade technology, flip this card and place it
on top of Cruiser II.</p>
<p><strong>Corsair (Cruiser III):</strong> If the active system contains
another player’s non-fighter ships, this unit can move through systems
that contain other players’ ships. Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | Move: 3 |
Capacity: 2</p>
<p>Cruiser super-upgrade. Requires Cruiser II first, then expedition
this breakthrough. Your cruisers become Corsairs: Cost 2, Combat 6, Move
3, Capacity 2, can move THROUGH enemy systems (bypasses blockades). Can
be skipped and gotten later to offset weak start. This is insane
mobility—you can move through opponent fleets to reach objectives,
bypass defenses, or strike deep into enemy territory.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iv.-structural-weaknesses">IV. Structural Weaknesses</h2>
<h3 id="a.-first-turn-priorities">A. First Turn Priorities</h3>
<p>Your Round 1 (R1) priority order: 1. <strong>Production</strong> -
Great priority 2. <strong>Technology</strong> - Great priority 3.
<strong>Scoring</strong> - Will have to be 3rd priority 4.
<strong>Breakthrough</strong> - Only if readily available</p>
<p><strong>Economic Constraint:</strong> Your economy will be too weak
if you spend on all of these. Prioritize production and tech, then
scoring only when economy allows.</p>
<p><strong>Expansion Notes:</strong> You have 1 carrier, 2 cruisers, 3
fighters, and 4 infantry. Problematic starting situation due to lack of
carry capacity. Focus on taking 2-3 systems R1 while positioning near
wealthy neighbors for Pillage opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy Token Priority:</strong> [User to provide]</p>
<h3 id="b.-neighbor-dependent-pillage">B. Neighbor-Dependent
Pillage</h3>
<p>Pillage only works on neighbors (adjacent players). If your neighbors
are poor (Sardakk, Arborec, Last Bastion), Pillage generates minimal
value.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> - During setup, lobby for seating next
to Hacan, Empyrean, Jol-Nar, Deepwrought (wealthy factions) - Expand to
create new adjacencies mid-game (become neighbors with more players) -
Fracture is helpful to create new neighbors and expand Pillage
opportunities - Focus on Ambush instead if neighbors are poor</p>
<h3 id="c.-diplomacy-and-player-anger-management">C. Diplomacy and
Player Anger Management</h3>
<p>The hardest part of playing Mentak is managing diplomacy and dealing
with everyone being angry at you. Pillage and Ambush make you a target
for retaliation and coalition-building against you.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> - Use Promise of Protection
strategically to befriend aggressive neighbors - Time your Pillage
carefully—don’t steal from everyone every round - Extract promissory
notes via Commander to create political leverage - Position yourself as
a necessary ally against bigger threats - Accept that some players will
always hate you—focus on managing the most dangerous ones</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="v.-technology">V. Technology</h2>
<h3 id="a.-core-tech-path">A. Core Tech Path</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Techs:</strong> - <strong>Sarween Tools
(GG)</strong> - Reduce production costs by 1 resource. Saves 25+
resources over the game. - <strong>Plasma Scoring (RR)</strong> - +1 die
for Space Cannon or Bombardment. Good for home defense and
invasions.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1: Neural Motivator (GG)</strong> - When 1 or more of
your units use Production, you may exhaust this card to reduce the
combined cost by the number of that unit’s production value. -
<strong>Why:</strong> Essential economic tech. Needed as prerequisite
for Cruiser II. Helps with your weak starting economy by reducing
production costs. Strong foundation for your tech path. -
<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 1 green (Sarween Tools)</p>
<p><strong>Round 2: Cruiser II (RR)</strong> - Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 |
Move: 3 | Capacity: 1 - <strong>Why:</strong> Your #1 priority tech.
Upgrades Ambush from 7+ (40% hit) to 6+ (50% hit). Move 3 gives
repositioning flexibility. The capacity 1 is a bonus. Essential for your
cruiser-based playstyle. - <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 1 green, 1
red, 1 yellow (Sarween Tools, Plasma Scoring, Neural Motivator)</p>
<p><strong>Round 3: Salvage Operations (YY) - Faction Tech</strong> -
After you win or lose a space combat, gain 1 trade good; if you won and
you destroyed 1 or more of your opponent’s ships, you may place 1 ship
from your reinforcements in that system’s space area. -
<strong>Why:</strong> Your signature combat tech. Gain 1 TG after EVERY
combat (win or lose). If you win, also produce 1 free ship. For
aggressive Mentak, this generates 7+ TGs and 7+ free ships over the
game. Incredible value. - <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 2 yellow
(Neural Motivator + Sarween Tools) - <strong>Note:</strong> If you can’t
get Salvage Operations Round 3, you need to find a double tech
opportunity—research 1 yellow prerequisite + Salvage Operations in the
same round using Technology strategy card or other double-tech
methods</p>
<p><strong>Round 4: Mirror Computing (YY) - Faction Tech</strong> - When
you spend trade goods, each trade good is worth 2 resources or 2
influence instead of 1. - <strong>Why:</strong> Doubles the value of
every TG you Pillage. If you steal 20 TGs via Pillage, Mirror Computing
makes them worth 40 resources/influence. Synergizes with Salvage
Operations. Late-game economy multiplier. -
<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 2 yellow (Salvage Operations + Neural
Motivator or Sarween Tools)</p>
<p><strong>Round 5+:</strong> Objectives-based techs or late-game
options</p>
<h3 id="b.-key-technologies">B. Key Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Cruiser II (RR):</strong> Essential for your faction.
Upgrades Ambush hit chance and gives move 3 for repositioning. Your
cruiser swarm strategy depends on this tech. Get this Round 2.</p>
<p><strong>Mirror Computing (YY):</strong> Your economic multiplier.
Doubles value of Pillaged TGs. Every TG you steal becomes worth 2
resources/influence. Late-game this makes you extremely wealthy.
Critical tech for leveraging your pirate economy.</p>
<h3 id="c.-late-game-options">C. Late-Game Options</h3>
<p><strong>Blue-Skip Gravity Drive (BB):</strong> If you blue-skip
Gravity Drive (using Technology strategy card’s blue-skip ability), your
cruisers gain the base move 3 + Gravity Drive’s +1 movement =
<strong>move 4</strong>. This creates surprise plays—you can reach
targets opponents don’t expect. Very powerful for Pillage positioning
and combat strikes.</p>
<p><strong>PDS II (RR) - For Unit Upgrade Objectives:</strong> Good
combo with your starting structure and Plasma Scoring. If you need a 2nd
unit upgrade for “Develop Weaponry” objective, PDS II works well. Your
Plasma Scoring already gives +1 die to Space Cannon, and upgrading to
PDS II (Space Cannon 5 x2) makes your home defense very strong.</p>
<p><strong>Integrated Economy (GG) - For Spice:</strong> Late-game tech
to leverage your riches. After you gain control of a planet, you may
produce up to 2 units on that planet. With your wealth from Pillage +
Mirror Computing, you can afford massive production across the map. Use
this to convert your economic advantage into fleet superiority.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vi.-strategy-cards">VI. Strategy Cards</h2>
<h3 id="a.-round-1-priority">A. Round 1 Priority</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Construction</strong> - Production at home for
expansion</li>
<li><strong>Technology</strong> - Helps R1 token economy and resources.
Progress toward Cruiser II</li>
<li><strong>Trade</strong> - Around 10 TG (3 TG + 2 commodities + ~5 TG
from other players)</li>
<li><strong>Leadership</strong> - CCs for expansion + positioning near
wealthy neighbors</li>
<li><strong>Warfare</strong> - Enables R1 expansion. Preferable not to
take, but can be necessary</li>
<li><strong>Politics</strong> - Speaker for agenda control (though 1
influence limits voting power)</li>
<li><strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Helps others more than you</li>
<li><strong>Imperial</strong> - Never R1</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="b.-round-2-priority">B. Round 2+ Priority</h3>
<p><strong>Love:</strong> - <strong>Leadership</strong> - CCs for
expansion and positioning near wealthy neighbors for Pillage -
<strong>Technology</strong> - Top priority to accelerate to Mirror
Computing. Cruiser II and Salvage Operations are essential techs</p>
<p><strong>Like:</strong> - <strong>Imperial</strong> - Points are
points - <strong>Politics</strong> - Agenda control, though low
influence limits effectiveness - <strong>Construction</strong> - Forward
dock for continued production. You also have decent PDS with Plasma
Scoring</p>
<p><strong>Situational:</strong> - <strong>Trade</strong> - You want
people to be rich so you can pillage more. Offer deals like getting a
free refresh or X+1 to make people feel comfortable taking Trade. The
richer they get, the more you can steal</p>
<p><strong>Hate:</strong> - <strong>Warfare</strong> - After round 1 -
<strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Not about defending. Helps others more than
you</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vii.-intermediate">VII. Intermediate</h2>
<h3 id="a.-unit-composition">A. Unit Composition</h3>
<p>Your fleet composition is unique—cruisers operate independently from
your main fleet:</p>
<p><strong>Independent Cruiser Strikes:</strong> - <strong>2-4 Cruisers
(alone)</strong> - Cruisers have move 3 (move 4 with Gravity Drive),
allowing sneaky maneuvers - Other ships can’t follow cruisers due to
movement speed difference - Send cruisers alone to strike targets,
extract promissory notes, and Pillage positioning - Ambush pre-combat
hits make solo cruiser groups dangerous - <strong>Spec Pirate
Combo:</strong> Cruisers + Mechs = lethal combination. Cruisers
transport mechs (capacity 1), mechs deny Sustain Damage on ground
invasions</p>
<p><strong>Main Fleet (Home Defense &amp; Late Game):</strong> -
<strong>Dreadnoughts</strong> - For late-game slice safety and heavy
combat - <strong>Carriers</strong> - For capacity and troop transport -
<strong>Fighters</strong> - Absorb hits - <strong>Infantry</strong> -
Ground forces</p>
<p>With Mirror Computing economy, you can afford expensive ships like
dreadnoughts for slice defense while your mobile cruisers operate
independently across the map. Cruisers do the pirate work, capital ships
defend territory.</p>
<h3 id="b.-game-plan">B. Game Plan</h3>
<p><strong>Focus on Economic Development and Board
Presence:</strong></p>
<p>Mentak is weak early game but scales into a rich, mobile menace with
cruiser swarms. Your game plan:</p>
<p><strong>Round 1-2: Survival and Setup</strong> - Expand with
Construction and grab systems near rich neighbors - Tech to Neural
Motivator → Cruiser II - Position yourself adjacent to wealthy factions
(Hacan, Empyrean, Jol-Nar, Deepwrought) - Start Pillaging TGs from
neighbor transactions - <strong>Priority: Keep your ships out on the
board.</strong> More ships on board = more Pillage opportunities and
threat projection</p>
<p><strong>Round 3-4: Acceleration</strong> - Get Salvage Operations and
Mirror Computing - Build cruiser swarms with Ambush - <strong>Cruiser II
gives excellent opportunity to find value in Fracture.</strong> Use move
3 cruisers to reach Fracture for relics and legendary planets - Start
extracting promissory notes via Commander (unlock at 4 cruisers) -
Mecatol Rex is probably out of reach—focus on Fracture and objectives
instead</p>
<p><strong>R5+: Dominance</strong> - You’re now rich from Pillage +
Mirror Computing - Cruiser swarms with Ambush make you dangerous in
combat - Use Hero to replicate enemy dreadnoughts/war suns for massive
tempo swing - Convert economic advantage to points</p>
<p><strong>Diplomacy and Pillage Policy:</strong> - <strong>Try and keep
some semblance of peaceful relations with your cash cows.</strong> You
want rich neighbors to stay rich so you can pillage more. - <strong>A
big part of not making people angry is being fair.</strong> Pillage
equally—don’t target one player too much. Spread the pain across
multiple neighbors. - <strong>No one should be exempted unless they pay
in other favors.</strong> Don’t give away Promise of Protection for
free. - Extract value from every neighbor—either pillage them or make
them pay to avoid being pillaged. - Keep ships spread across the board
to maximize adjacencies and Pillage opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Commander promissory extraction is hard, but
PN Bonus point can be used for late-game sneaky ways to get Support for
the Throne.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="viii.-objectives">VIII. Objectives</h2>
<h3 id="a.-objective-summary">A. Objective Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Mentak excels at spending objectives once
Pillage and Mirror Computing economies kick in mid-game. Combat
objectives are easy with Ambush pre-combat hits and cruiser-focused
fleets, and mobile cruisers provide good map presence for territorial
objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Early game spending objectives are
challenging before Pillage accumulates trade goods. Influence spending
is difficult with only 1 home influence, requiring aggressive planet
conquest to compensate.</p>

<p><strong>Legend:</strong> 🟢 Likely | 🟡 Possible | 🔴 Difficult</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> - All Stage II spending objectives are
easy—your economy (Pillage + Mirror Computing) should have kicked in by
then - Early game (Stage I) spending can be kind of annoying before your
economy scales up - Combat objectives favor aggressive playstyle -
Mobile cruiser fleets give you good map presence for territorial
objectives</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="ix.-alliance-priority">IX. Alliance Priority</h2>
<p>Alliance preference ranking based on commander utility:</p>
<p><strong>Top Tier (Money-Making):</strong> 1. <strong>Muaat</strong>
(Magmus) - Gain 1 TG after spending strategy pool token. Incredible
passive income. 2. <strong>Titans of Ul</strong> (Tungstantus) - Gain 1
TG when using production. Synergizes perfectly with your playstyle. 3.
<strong>Crimson Rebellion</strong> (Ahk Siever) - Gain 1 commodity/TG
after any combat. You fight constantly—this prints money. 4.
<strong>Deepwrought</strong> (Aello) - Gain commodity/TG when others
research tech. Passive income.</p>
<p><strong>Useful:</strong> 5. <strong>Nomad</strong> (Navarch Feng) -
Produce flagship without spending resources. Free flagship production.
6. <strong>Yin Brotherhood</strong> (Brother Omar) - Satisfies green
prerequisite and ignore tech prerequisites when researching other
players’ techs. Tech flexibility. 7. <strong>Empyrean</strong> (Xuange)
- Return command tokens when other players move into systems with your
tokens. Command token efficiency. 8. <strong>Vuil’raith</strong> (That
Which Molds Flesh) - Up to 2 fighters/infantry don’t count against
production limit. Extra production capacity. 9. <strong>Yssaril</strong>
(So Ata) - Look at other players’ action cards/promissory notes/secrets
when they activate systems with your units. Extra value as deterrent
since you’ll be attacked a lot.</p>

<p>Mentak Coalition is a low-tier faction that makes people mad. You
thrive on economic theft and mobile cruiser warfare. Your success
depends on:</p>
<p><strong>Neighbor Selection:</strong> Position yourself next to rich,
non-aggressive neighbors. You want factions with high commodity counts
that will generate lots of TGs through trade, not combat-focused
factions that will retaliate when you Pillage them.</p>
<p><strong>The Angry Table Problem:</strong> The hardest part of playing
Mentak is managing the table’s anger. Everyone hates being pillaged. You
need to: - Be fair with Pillage distribution—spread the pain equally -
Use diplomacy to keep some semblance of peaceful relations with your
cash cows - Extract value from Promise of Protection deals with
neighbors who fear you - Accept that you’ll be a target, and position
accordingly</p>
<p><strong>Economic Scaling:</strong> You start weak but scale into a
wealthy, mobile menace. Pillage generates passive income. Mirror
Computing doubles your stolen TG value. By late game, you’re rich enough
to afford expensive fleets and buy political influence.</p>
<p><strong>What’s yours is ours, AAARRRRR!</strong></p>
