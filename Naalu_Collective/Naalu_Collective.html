<hr />
<h2 id="i.-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>The Naalu Collective are TI4’s clairvoyant faction—you see what’s
coming and act first. While other factions react to events, you shape
them. You know when to score, when to strike, when to vanish.
Initiative-0 means you always go first, choosing your moment before
anyone else can respond.</p>
<p>This faction is about perfect foresight and fighter swarms. Act first
if you want. Retreat before battle if you don’t. Your opponents never
know which you’ll choose, and by the time they act, it’s already too
late. In Twilight Imperium, seeing the future is everything.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-playstyle">II. Playstyle</h2>
<p>Playing Naalu Collective is about staying out of the limelight while
being surprisingly strong. You’re not the obvious threat—until you score
objectives first every round. Your fighter swarms dominate combat more
than opponents expect. While others fumble in the darkness of future
agendas, you see what’s coming and plan accordingly.</p>
<p>Your playstyle revolves around acting first and staying flexible.
Score objectives before anyone else. Build fighter swarms for combat
superiority. Retreat from fights you don’t want, making opponents waste
activations chasing you. Your Commander lets you see neighbor
promissories and upcoming agendas—information no one else has.</p>
<p>Foresight and initiative define you. Act first when it matters.
Vanish when it doesn’t. Know what’s coming while opponents guess. Stay
quiet, score first, and let the table underestimate you until it’s too
late.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iii.-the-basics">III. The Basics</h2>
<h3 id="a.-home-system-commodities">A. Home System &amp;
Commodities</h3>
<p><strong>Home System:</strong> - <strong>Druaa:</strong> 3 resources /
1 influence - <strong>Maaluuk:</strong> 0 resources / 2 influence -
<strong>Total: 3 resources / 3 influence (3 optimal resources / 2
optimal influence)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commodities:</strong> 3</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Two-planet home system hard to defend on
ground. Luckily you have strong fighters. Solid economical home system.
Decent production.</p>
<h3 id="b.-starting-fleet">B. Starting Fleet</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 Carrier</li>
<li>1 Cruiser</li>
<li>1 Destroyer</li>
<li>3 Fighters (Hybrid Crystal Fighters I)</li>
<li>4 Infantry</li>
<li>1 Space Dock</li>
<li>1 PDS</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Solid starting fleet for expansion. 3 Hybrid
Crystal Fighters (Combat 8). Agent allows you to reach all systems in
slice usually.</p>
<h3 id="c.-faction-abilities">C. Faction Abilities</h3>
<p><strong>Telepathic (Faction Ability):</strong> At the end of the
strategy phase, place the Naalu “0” token on your strategy card; you are
first in initiative order.</p>
<p>You act first every action phase. Double-edged sword—good for
aggressive plays and awesome for scoring, but risk getting outstalled
and showing your hand at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Foresight (Faction Ability):</strong> After another player
moves ships into a system that contains 1 or more of your ships, you may
place 1 token from your strategy pool in an adjacent system that does
not contain another player’s ships; move your ships from the active
system into that system.</p>
<p>Retreat before combat begins. Spend 1 CC from strategy pool to move
all your ships to adjacent empty system when opponent activates you.
Costly but preserves forces.</p>
<p><strong>Hybrid Crystal Fighter I (Special Unit):</strong> Naalu
Fighter - Cost: 1 (x2) | Combat: 8</p>
<p>Combat 8 fighters provide additional combat power in early scraps.
Can be impactful for equidistant systems.</p>
<h3 id="d.-starting-and-faction-technologies">D. Starting and Faction
Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Technologies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sarween Tools</strong> - When you use PRODUCTION, reduce the
combined cost of produced units by 1.</p>
<p><strong>Neural Motivator</strong> - When you gain command tokens
during the status phase, gain 1 additional command token.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Two of those technologies you just love to
start with. Neural Motivator gives 4-5 extra action cards over the
course of the game. Sarween Tools saves probably 8-10 resources spent on
production over the course of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Faction Technologies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hybrid Crystal Fighter II (GB):</strong> <em>Naalu Fighter -
Combat: 7 | Move: 2</em></p>
<p>This unit may move without being transported. Each fighter in excess
of your ships’ capacity counts as 1/2 of a ship against your fleet
pool.</p>
<p>Your faction’s battle prowess. Incredible utility moving on its own.
People will be shocked at how many hits you produce—a dreadnought hits
on a 5, a HCF2 hits on a 7. Having your fighters be your battle power is
so good economically since they’re so cheap. <strong>Battle
example:</strong> A 13-resource Naalu fleet (2 Carrier I + 14 Fighter
II) fights 50/50 against a 23-resource fleet (4 Dreadnought II + 1
Carrier + 8 Fighters).</p>
<p><strong>Neuroglaive (GGG):</strong> <em>After another player
activates a system that contains 1 or more of your ships, that player
removes 1 token from his fleet pool and returns it to his
reinforcements.</em></p>
<p>Hard to reach tech. Not preferred path into green—try to get through
Entropic Scar. Annoying for opponents that are poor influence-wise but
usually able to be planned around.</p>
<h3 id="e.-leaders">E. Leaders</h3>
<p><strong>Agent - Z’eu (Temporal Entanglement):</strong></p>
<p>After any player’s command token is placed in a system: You may
exhaust this card to return that token to that player’s
reinforcements.</p>
<p>Increased mobility. Great usage for early slice grabbing.</p>
<p><strong>Commander - M’aban (Codex 3):</strong> <em>Unlock: Have
ground forces in or adjacent to the Mecatol Rex system.</em></p>
<p>At any time: You may look at your neighbors’ hands of promissory
notes and the top and bottom card of the agenda deck.</p>
<p>Usually better for agendas for seasoned players that usually know
what the secret trades entailed. Can surprise people that made a sneaky
PN deal.</p>
<p><strong>Hero - The Oracle (Codex 3):</strong> <em>Unlock: Have 3
scored objectives.</em></p>
<p><strong>C-Radium Geometry - At the end of the status phase:</strong>
You may force each other player to give you 1 promissory note from their
hand. If you do, purge this card.</p>
<p>Synergy with breakthrough (Mindsieve). Use ASAP just to get any
value. If people moved their PNs around a lot, can catch people off
guard.</p>
<h3 id="f.-promissory-note---gift-of-prescience">F. Promissory Note -
<strong>Gift of Prescience</strong></h3>
<p>At the end of the Strategy Phase: Place this card faceup in your play
area and place the Naalu “0” token on your strategy card; you are the
first in initiative order. The Naalu player cannot use his Telepathic
faction ability during this game round. Return this card to the Naalu
player at the end of the status phase.</p>
<p>Only sell for Round 2 custodians if you have no interest. Never let
people have this for late game scoring.</p>
<h3 id="g.-alliance">G. Alliance</h3>
<p>Whoever holds your alliance card has your Commander (M’aban - look at
neighbors’ promissory hands and top/bottom agenda cards).</p>
<p>Trade for any value, won’t net you a lot.</p>
<h3 id="h.-mech---iconoclast-temporal-entanglement">H. Mech -
<strong>Iconoclast (Temporal Entanglement)</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | <strong>Sustain Damage</strong></p>
<p><strong>DEPLOY:</strong> When another player gains a relic, place 1
mech on any planet you control.</p>
<p>Free mech when any player gains a relic. Passive mech generation.
Buffed with Fracture and certain factions (Naaz-Rokha and Mahact).</p>
<h3 id="i.-flagship---matriarch">I. Flagship -
<strong>Matriarch</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 8 | Combat: 9 (x2) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 6 | <strong>Sustain
Damage</strong></p>
<p><strong>Special Ability:</strong> During an invasion in this system,
you may commit fighters to planets as if they were ground forces. When
combat ends, return those units to the space area.</p>
<p>Fighters participate in ground combat as ground forces, then return
to space after. Great for big takes of Mecatol/Styx—can guarantee a
blowout space combat and then send them all down to have a blowout
ground combat after. Stronger than normal infantry when upgraded (HCF2
hits on 7 vs infantry on 8).</p>
<h3 id="j.-breakthrough">J. Breakthrough</h3>
<p><strong>Mindsieve (R&lt;&gt;G)</strong> - When you would resolve the
secondary ability of another player’s strategy card, you may give them a
promissory note to resolve it without spending a command token.</p>
<p><strong>R&lt;&gt;G Synergy:</strong> Red and green technologies count
as each other for prerequisites.</p>
<p>You can make deals every time for free strategy tokens—pay a TG here,
a TG there, small favor there. Try to be proactive and deal constantly
with the breakthrough. Your “useless PNs” can now be used for strategy
tokens. Not a lot of use for R&lt;&gt;G synergy.</p>
<h3 id="k.-slice-and-draft-considerations">K. Slice and Draft
Considerations</h3>
<p><strong>Speaker Order:</strong> Prefer strong early value. Positions
1-4 are best. Can handle most neighbors.</p>
<p><strong>Slice Priorities:</strong> - <strong>Safe slice</strong> -
Your economic tools are very strong (free secondaries, cheap fleet). Can
get away with lower res/influence, but more is better always. -
<strong>High res planets</strong> - Want a few for production capacity.
- <strong>Mecatol access</strong> - Custodian possibility.</p>
<p><strong>Nice to Have:</strong> - <strong>Blue skip</strong> - Very
helpful. - <strong>Entropic Scar</strong> - Loves it. - <strong>Space
Station</strong> - TG to trade for PNs.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid:</strong> - <strong>Gravity rift/nova/asteroid in path
to Mecatol</strong> - Blocks access.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iv.-structural-weaknesses">IV. Structural Weaknesses</h2>
<h3 id="a.-first-turn-priorities">A. First Turn Priorities</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1 Priority Rankings:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Scoring</strong> - Stay in line if people are scoring,
otherwise lower priority. Don’t want to show off as
strong/winning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expansion and Production</strong> - Get economy
started.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Breakthrough</strong> - Economic boost. Easiest unlock
with throwing secret.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology</strong> - Can be lesser priority. Plastic
over tech Round 1.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Expansion Notes:</strong> Take fleet to middle system, lift
token (agent), go again. Then take system next to your home with Warfare
build.</p>
<h3 id="b.-threat-of-winning">B. Threat of Winning</h3>
<p>People are afraid of you winning all game. Your initiative-0 and
scoring first every round makes opponents view you as a constant threat.
This strains your diplomatic capability—the table will target you even
when you’re not actually winning.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="v.-technology">V. Technology</h2>
<h3 id="a.-overview">A. Overview</h3>
<p>Strong economic start with bonus action cards. Focus on fighter
upgrades. Best path is probably blue for utility, carrier capacity, and
movement.</p>
<h3 id="b.-tech-path">B. Tech Path</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Tech:</strong> Sarween Tools + Neural Motivator</p>
<p><strong>Round 1:</strong> Dark Energy Tap (if available from
slice/deals) - Extra frontier token, retreat flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>Round 2:</strong> Hybrid Crystal Fighter II (GB) - Faction
tech. Independent movement, 0.5 fleet cost.</p>
<p><strong>Round 3:</strong> Gravity Drive (B) - +1 move to 1 ship after
activating.</p>
<p><strong>Round 4:</strong> Carrier II (BB) or Fleet Logistics (BB) -
Carrier II for capacity, Fleet Logistics for double actions. - Fleet
Logistics enables crazy Imperial scoring on Mecatol and then also
scoring first with the Imperial card in the last round.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If blue tech skip, can go Gravity Drive first
(Round 2).</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vi.-strategy-cards">VI. Strategy Cards</h2>
<h3 id="a.-round-1">A. Round 1</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1 Priority Ranking:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Trade</strong> - Economy for fighter production. 3
commodities.</li>
<li><strong>Technology</strong> - Start fighter upgrade path.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership</strong> - For secondaries.</li>
<li><strong>Politics</strong> - Good for setting up scoring Round
2.</li>
<li><strong>Construction</strong> - Forward dock for production. Better
if you have a great planet to place forward dock on.</li>
<li><strong>Warfare</strong> - Useless with your agent.</li>
<li><strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Last pick option.</li>
<li><strong>Imperial</strong> - Never Round 1.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Strategy Token Priority:</strong> Diplomacy, Warfare, and
Technology. If you got breakthrough, make deal for a bonus
secondary.</p>
<h3 id="b.-round-2">B. Round 2+</h3>
<p><strong>Love:</strong> - <strong>Trade</strong> - Economy. Abuse your
breakthrough to save tokens. - <strong>Technology</strong> - Fighter
upgrades. Abuse your breakthrough to save tokens. -
<strong>Imperial</strong> - Score first with initiative-0.</p>
<p><strong>Good:</strong> - <strong>Leadership</strong> - Tokens. If
table not playing nice with breakthrough deals. -
<strong>Politics</strong> - Setup Imperial. Advantage of speaker with
Commander (know top/bottom agendas).</p>
<p><strong>Situational:</strong> - <strong>Warfare</strong> - Aggressive
plays. Fleet unlock after attacks. - <strong>Construction</strong> -
Forward dock. - <strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Only for home system
lockdown.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vii.-intermediate">VII. Intermediate</h2>
<h3 id="a.-unit-composition">A. Unit Composition</h3>
<p><strong>Preferred Units:</strong> - <strong>Fighters</strong> - Core
unit. Combat 8. Build swarms. - <strong>Carriers</strong> - Transport
infantry and fighters. - <strong>Infantry</strong> - Ground forces. -
<strong>Mechs</strong> - Get for free everywhere (when players gain
relics). - <strong>Flagship</strong> - Fighters fight on ground.</p>
<p>Your composition is incredibly cheap if you have production capacity
for it. Fighter swarms provide overwhelming combat power at minimal
cost.</p>
<h3 id="b.-game-plan">B. Game Plan</h3>
<p><strong>Early Game (Rounds 1-2):</strong></p>
<p>Use initiative-0 to claim best planets with 0 tokens. Use agent to
fill out rest of slice and get a head start economically. Do not
Foresight retreat—that’s a waste of tokens. Build fighter swarms for
combat. Consider custodians if you didn’t score Round 1. Try to get
trades of secondaries started (breakthrough deals).</p>
<p><strong>Mid Game (Rounds 3-4):</strong></p>
<p>Research Hybrid Crystal Fighter II for independent movement and
combat superiority. Continue building fighter swarms—you want
overwhelming numbers. Commander unlocks—if lucky, get ahead on agendas
with intelligence advantage. Your breakthrough deals should be flowing
now, saving tokens on every secondary. Build up plastic and economy.
Hero steals all opponent promissories for political leverage. If
controlling Mecatol in mid game, consider the first action Imperial for
massive point swing. Stay under the radar while accumulating
strength.</p>
<p><strong>Late Game (Round 5+):</strong></p>
<p>Make a big swing play if not already running away with the game.
Flagship invasions, massive fighter swarms, and initiative-0 scoring
give you the tools to close it out.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="viii.-objectives">VIII. Objectives</h2>
<h3 id="a.-objective-summary">A. Objective Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Initiative-0 lets you score objectives
first. Economy objectives benefit from breakthrough saving tokens.
Combat objectives align with fighter swarms.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Tech objectives challenging despite 2
starting techs. Structure objectives difficult. Hard to spread out and
not become a target with the Naalu bullseye on you.</p>

<p>Naalu Collective is the faction for players who love staying under
the radar while being surprisingly strong. You’re not the obvious
powerhouse—you’re the faction that quietly scores objectives and
snatches the win before anyone can react. Your initiative-0 is a
double-edged sword with big scoring implications late game, but the
surprise factor is powerful.</p>
<p>Your biggest strength is that you’re stronger than people expect.
Your fighter swarms dominate combat at a fraction of the cost. Your
breakthrough saves tokens on every secondary. Your Commander gives you
information others don’t have. While the table focuses on louder
factions, you’re scoring first, expanding first, and positioning
first.</p>
<p>When you master Naalu Collective, you feel like you’re seeing the
future while everyone else guesses. The table underestimates you until
suddenly you’re scoring objectives they thought they had secured. Naalu
Collective doesn’t announce their plans—they execute them before anyone
knows what happened.</p>
<p><strong>We see the future. We act on it.</strong></p>
