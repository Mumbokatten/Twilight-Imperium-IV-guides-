<h2 id="i.-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>The Deepwrought Scholarate is TI4’s coexistence and technology
specialist, a faction that fundamentally reimagines how ground forces
interact with planets. While other factions see invasion as
winner-takes-all, you see it as an opportunity to establish shared
research bases. You’re the faction that can occupy enemy planets without
controlling them, generate economic value from this coexistence, and use
your technological superiority to outpace everyone at the table.</p>
<p>Your defining trait is the coexistence mechanic combined with ocean
cards. When your ground forces begin coexisting on a planet (sharing it
with another player’s units), you gain ocean cards that provide various
economic and strategic benefits. This creates a unique playstyle where
you’re incentivized to spread your infantry across the galaxy,
establishing research outposts on planets you don’t fully control.</p>
<p>The Deepwrought Scholarate excels at technological advancement,
economic generation through ocean cards, and diplomatic flexibility. You
start by researching 2 technologies during setup, giving you the
strongest tech start in the entire game. Your faction technologies let
you swap techs for better ones and generate trade goods from your ocean
cards. You’re not the strongest militarily, but you’re the smartest -
and intelligence wins wars.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-playstyle">II. Playstyle</h2>
<p>The Deepwrought philosophy is peaceful coexistence combined with
technological supremacy. You’re a diplomatic powerhouse - nobody hates
the friendly techy fish who helps everyone research technologies and
peacefully coexists on planets. Until it’s too late, and the fish has
been so well fed through passive income and technological advantages
that they’re ready to win the game.</p>
<p>Early game Deepwrought focuses on maximizing your starting technology
advantage. You research 2 techs during setup, giving you a massive head
start. You want to identify which technologies will best support your
game plan and grab them immediately. Simultaneously, you spread infantry
to establish coexistence on neighbor planets, building goodwill while
generating ocean cards.</p>
<p>Mid-game transitions into ocean card economy and technology trading.
Your agent helps allies research tech while placing your infantry in
coexistence, spreading your presence further. Your commander generates
passive income whenever others research, creating a snowball effect -
the more you help the table tech, the richer you become.</p>
<p>Late game Deepwrought is about technological dominance and Radical
Advancement value. By now, you should have a robust tech tree and be
swapping technologies to get exactly what you need. Your hero can delete
critical technologies from opponents’ arsenals, shutting down their
strategies. Your flagship’s unique movement ability lets you navigate
contested space. Most importantly, your “friendly fish” reputation
should have kept you safe while you built an insurmountable
advantage.</p>
<h2 id="iii.-the-basics">III. The Basics</h2>
<h3 id="a.-home-system-commodities">A. Home System &amp;
Commodities</h3>
<p><strong>Home System:</strong> Ikatena - 4 resources / 4 influence -
<strong>Total: 2 optimal resources / 2 optimal influence</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commodities:</strong> 3</p>
<p>Your home system is 4/4, but you can only spend resources from one of
the two planets at a time (2/2 optimal). However, this is still very
strong and easy to defend with both planets in the same system. The 4
influence is valuable for the agenda phase.</p>
<h3 id="b.-starting-fleet">B. Starting Fleet</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 Dreadnought</li>
<li>1 Carrier (capacity 6)</li>
<li>4 Fighters</li>
<li>3 Infantry</li>
<li>1 Space Dock</li>
</ul>
<p>You start with a dreadnought, which gives you strong early combat
capability and Sustain Damage. However, you only have 3 infantry, which
limits your ability to establish widespread coexistence relationships
early. You’ll need to produce more infantry quickly to maximize your
ocean card economy.</p>
<h3 id="c.-starting-tech">C. Starting Tech</h3>
<p><strong>During Setup, research Technology twice</strong></p>
<p>This is the strongest starting tech advantage in the game. You can
research ANY two technologies, but must respect prerequisites (you need
blue to get second blue, etc.). Your main paths:</p>
<p><strong>Blue Path:</strong> - <strong>Antimass Deflectors + Dark
Energy Tap (or Gravity Drive):</strong> Movement flexibility and
economy, sets up Fleet Logistics or Lightwave Deflector</p>
<p><strong>Green Path:</strong> - <strong>Neural Motivator +
Bio-Stims:</strong> Command token efficiency plus fighter production
boost, path to breakthrough unlock. Then use Radical Advancement to swap
Bio-Stims for Hyper Metabolism later for token economy</p>
<h3 id="d.-faction-abilities">D. Faction Abilities</h3>
<p><strong>Research Team:</strong> When ground forces are committed, if
your units on that planet are not already coexisting, you may choose for
your units to coexist.</p>
<p>This is your core mechanic and it’s insanely valuable. Instead of
invading planets normally, you can choose to coexist. Your infantry
shares the planet with the owner’s units without triggering invasion
combat. Both players can use the planet’s resources/influence, but only
the original controller truly “controls” it for objective purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Key Strategic Value:</strong> Coexistence means you don’t
fully lose planets when invaded - you keep access to the
resources/influence even if you’re not the controller. Most importantly,
coexisting on your home system planets means you still count as
“controlling” your home system for scoring purposes, which is almost
broken strong. You can be invaded and still score home system
objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Oceanbound:</strong> When your units begin coexisting on a
planet, gain an ocean card and ready it. Any time you have more ocean
cards than there are planets that contain your coexisting units, discard
ocean cards until you do not.</p>
<p>Ocean cards provide various benefits (resources, influence, trade
goods, movement, etc.) and <strong>come into play readied</strong>. This
is crucial: whenever you have exhausted ocean cards, you should be
looking for coexistence opportunities because the new ocean card comes
in ready, giving you immediate value. Ocean cards are the engine that
funds your strategy.</p>
<h3 id="e.-leaders">E. Leaders</h3>
<p><strong>Agent - Doctor Carrina:</strong> When another player
researches a technology, you may exhaust this card to allow that player
to ignore 1 prerequisite. If they do, you may place 1 infantry from your
reinforcements into coexistence on a non-home planet they control.</p>
<p>This is diplomatic gold and should be used ASAP every tech round.
Ideally, use it on the Technology primary player (round 1) so everyone
at the table can benefit from the prerequisite ignore, making you
extremely popular while spreading your infantry into coexistence. Once
your commander unlocks, all this tech research generates
commodities/trade goods for you - you’re literally getting paid to help
people.</p>
<p><strong>Commander - Aello:</strong> - <strong>Unlock:</strong> Have
an ocean card in play - <strong>Ability:</strong> When another player
spends resources to research a technology, that player may reduce the
cost by 1. If they do, gain 1 commodity or convert 1 of your commodities
to a trade good.</p>
<p>Your commander unlocks extremely early (as soon as you have 1 ocean
card) and generates passive income whenever anyone researches tech.
Since tech research happens constantly, you’re generating 3-5
commodities/trade goods per round just by existing. The table won’t
notice the corruption of cheap tech until it’s too late - they’re happy
getting discounted research while you’re quietly building an
insurmountable economic advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Hero - Ta Zern:</strong> - <strong>Unlock:</strong> Have 3
scored objectives - <strong>Wave Function Collapse:</strong> Purge this
card and a non-unit upgrade technology you own or from your deck. Then,
purge all cards with the same name owned by other players and in other
players’ decks. Then, each player that purged a technology they owned
researches another technology.</p>
<p>This hero is a bit weak overall, but picking the right tech at the
right timing can absolutely win games. Delete Gravity Drive from the
player threatening to take Mecatol, purge Fleet Logistics from someone
setting up a double-activation power play, or remove a critical unit
upgrade before a key combat. The key is timing - use it when removing a
specific tech swings the game state in your favor.</p>
<h3 id="f.-promissory-note">F. Promissory Note</h3>
<p><strong>Share Knowledge:</strong> Place this card faceup in your play
area and gain 1 non-faction, non-unit upgrade technology that the
Deepwrought player owns. Place that technology on this card. Return that
technology to the deck and this card to the Deepwrought player at the
end of the status phase.</p>
<p>This is worth at least 2 TG every turn and you should sell it as much
as possible. Be proactive - look for what people need. Someone needs
Hyper Metabolism for infantry? Sell them Share Knowledge for a command
token or trade goods. Someone needs Sarween Tools? That’s worth even
more. Since you research 2 techs at setup and have access to a diverse
tech tree, you’ll almost always have something valuable to lend. This
promissory note is a constant income stream - treat it like a renewable
resource.</p>
<h3 id="g.-alliance">G. Alliance</h3>
<p>When a player researches a technology, they may choose to apply your
commander’s discount, your ally’s commander’s discount, or both if they
want - it’s always applicable.</p>
<p>Since you can never deny someone from using your commander discount
anyway, the alliance primarily helps relations with whoever has your
alliance card. It ensures your ally always has guaranteed access to tech
discounts (and players can stack both discounts if applicable) and
creates a strong diplomatic bond. This is more about cementing a key
friendship than restricting the table.</p>
<h3 id="h.-mech">H. Mech</h3>
<p><strong>Eanautic:</strong> Cost 2, Combat 6, Sustain Damage,
PRODUCTION 1</p>
<p>When another player activates this system, if this unit is
coexisting, you may move it and any of your infantry on its planet to a
planet you control in your home system.</p>
<p>Your mechs have PRODUCTION 1 and can retreat to safety when enemies
activate the system where they’re coexisting. This makes them defensive
coexistence anchors that produce units while sitting on enemy
planets.</p>
<h3 id="i.-flagship">I. Flagship</h3>
<p><strong>D.W.S. Luminous:</strong> Cost 8, Combat 7 (x2), Move 1,
Capacity 6, Sustain Damage</p>
<p>This ship can move through systems that contain your units, even if
other players’ units are present. If it would, apply +1 to its move
value for each of those systems.</p>
<p>Your flagship can move through contested systems as long as you have
units there. If you have coexisting infantry scattered across the
galaxy, your flagship can chain through these systems, gaining +1
movement for each. This can result in 4-5 movement in a single
activation.</p>
<h3 id="j.-breakthrough">J. Breakthrough</h3>
<p><strong>Visionaria Select:</strong> Y&lt;&gt;G (Yellow-Green
synergy)</p>
<p><strong>ACTION:</strong> Exhaust this card to allow each other player
to spend 3 trade goods and give you 1 promissory note. Each player that
does may research a non-faction, non-unit upgrade technology. You also
gain each technology researched in this way.</p>
<p>Look, people are gonna see this as poison after one game against
Deepwrought. They’re not stupid. So you gotta sweeten the deal - offer
back promissory notes, maybe split the cost (PN back plus you pay 1 TG
for techs you actually want). If you can get 3 players to bite, you’re
getting 3 free technologies. Having access to every tech in the game?
Pretty, pretty, pretty good.</p>
<h3 id="k.-slice-considerations">K. Slice Considerations</h3>
<p>You really want your faction breakthrough, so position can have some
importance for accessing those tech skips. But damn if this faction
isn’t easy to slice with - it’s probably the most flexible faction in
the game. Any high value and safe slice will do you good.</p>
<p><strong>Prioritize Point-Scoring Slices:</strong> Since you’re so
flexible with tech and economy, focus on slices that help you score
objectives: - 4+ planets of one type (cultural/hazardous/industrial) for
Stage II objectives - less critical because coexistence lets you access
neighbor planets, but always helpful - Anomalies for “control 2
anomalies” objectives - 6+ total planets within reach for “control 6
planets” objectives - High total value planets for “spend X
resources/influence” objectives - Tech skips are nice but not critical -
most likely people will give you techs to smooth out any tech plan</p>
<p><strong>What Works:</strong> - Pretty much anything that’s not total
garbage - You start with 2 techs, so you’re not desperate for tech skips
- Coexistence means you can spread to neighbor planets anyway - Your
economic engines (ocean cards, commander, Hydrothermal Mining) work
anywhere - Your massive tech advantage and economy will find a way</p>
<p><strong>Avoid:</strong> - Very low total value slices (you need
production capacity and planet value) - Isolated slices with no neighbor
contact (you need coexistence opportunities)</p>
<p><strong>Speaker Priority:</strong> Flexible (any position works)</p>
<p>You’re very flexible with speaker order. Just grab value strategy
cards (Trade, Leadership, Technology) and you’ll make it work. You’re
not desperate for any particular card or position.</p>
<h2 id="iv.-structural-weaknesses">IV. Structural Weaknesses</h2>
<h3 id="a.-first-turn-priorities">A. First Turn Priorities</h3>
<p>Your R1 priority order: 1. <strong>Score</strong> - Flexible start,
so get started on points early 2. <strong>Breakthrough</strong> - Get
the tech train started via cheaper tech acquisition (better than
researching normally) 3. <strong>Produce and Expand</strong> - Add
expansion capability to be more flexible in round 2 4.
<strong>Tech</strong> - Probably not needed since you already start with
2 techs and can use breakthrough for future research</p>
<p><strong>Expansion Notes:</strong> You start with 1 dreadnought, 1
carrier, 4 fighters, and 3 infantry. Strong starting fleet for expansion
with early Sustain Damage. Focus on taking 2-3 systems R1 while
positioning near neighbors to establish coexistence opportunities. Your
3 infantry limit expansion - you’ll need to produce more infantry to
continue taking planets.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy Token Priority:</strong> Diplomacy, Warfare, and
whatever you need for scoring</p>
<h3 id="b.-coexistence-vulnerability">B. Coexistence Vulnerability</h3>
<p>Your ocean card economy depends on maintaining coexistence. If
opponents fully invade planets where you’re coexisting, you lose those
ocean cards. This makes you vulnerable to aggressive ground combat.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> - Maintain friendly relations with
players you’re coexisting with</p>
<h3 id="c.-combat-weakness">C. Combat Weakness</h3>
<p>You have no combat bonuses or special combat abilities. However, this
weakness isn’t as bad as it seems - you’ll have tons of upgraded units
and tech advantages that compensate.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation:</strong> - Your technological superiority means
you get unit upgrades much earlier than opponents - Avoid unnecessary
fights - use coexistence instead of invasion when possible - Use
diplomacy and Share Knowledge to build alliances - Your flagship can
move through systems with your units, enabling repositioning when
needed</p>
<h2 id="v.-technology">V. Technology</h2>
<h3 id="a.-starting-technologies">A. Starting Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Research 2 technologies during setup (must respect
prerequisites)</strong></p>
<p>This is the strongest starting tech advantage in the game. Focus on
blue or green paths:</p>
<p><strong>Blue Path (Most Common):</strong> - <strong>Dark Energy Tap
(or Antimass Deflectors) + Gravity Drive:</strong> Gives slice
flexibility with increased movement</p>
<p><strong>Green Path:</strong> More economic but less flexible. -
<strong>Neural Motivator + Bio-Stims:</strong> Command token efficiency
plus fighter production boost, path to breakthrough unlock. Then use
Radical Advancement to swap Bio-Stims for Hyper Metabolism later for
token economy - <strong>Neural Motivator + Radical Advancement:</strong>
Get your faction tech immediately for tech swapping flexibility</p>
<h3 id="b.-technology-acquisition-strategy">B. Technology Acquisition
Strategy</h3>
<p>Deepwrought plays tech differently than any other faction. You
acquire most techs from other players via your breakthrough ability, but
can only research unit upgrades and faction techs yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Research These Yourself:</strong></p>
<p><em>Unit Upgrades:</em> - Carrier II (core) - Dreadnought II (core) -
Destroyer II (solid combat option) - Fighter II (if needed) - War Sun
(filthy rich fun option)</p>
<p><em>Faction Techs:</em> - Hydrothermal Mining - Very solid, generates
1 TG per ocean card each status phase - Radical Advancement - Mostly
situational since you’ll have many techs; use to swap for specific
objectives</p>
<p><strong>Get Via Breakthrough:</strong></p>
<p>Your breakthrough lets players pay 3 TG and give you a PN to research
tech, and you copy whatever they research. The key is making this
attractive - offer their PN back if you don’t already have the tech
they’re researching, or even sweeten the deal by giving back PN + 1 TG
to offset their tech cost. This turns breakthrough from “obviously
helping Deepwrought too much” into “actually a pretty good deal.”</p>
<p><em>Blue:</em> - Antimass Deflectors - Offer PN back - Dark Energy
Tap - Offer PN back - Sling Relay - Willing to pay - Gravity Drive -
Willing to pay - Fleet Logistics - Willing to pay - Lightwave Deflector
- Willing to pay</p>
<p><em>Yellow:</em> - Sarween Tools - Offer PN back - Scanlink Drone
Network - Offer PN back - Graviton Laser System - Offer PN back -
Predictive Intelligence - Offer PN back - Transit Diodes - Willing to
pay - Integrated Economy - Offer PN back</p>
<p><em>Red:</em> - Plasma Scoring - Offer PN back - AI Development
Algorithm - Offer PN back - Magen Defense Grid - Offer PN back -
Self-Assembly Routines - Offer PN back - Duranium Armor - Willing to pay
- Assault Cannon - Willing to pay</p>
<p><em>Green:</em> - Neural Motivator - Offer PN back if not starting
tech - Bio-Stims - Willing to pay - Hyper Metabolism - Willing to pay -
X-89 Bacterial Weapon - Willing to pay - Psychoarchaeology - Low
priority - Dacxive Animators - Low priority</p>
<p><strong>Note on Tech Flexibility:</strong> You have incredible tech
flexibility. Never be afraid to research a tech yourself if it helps
with scoring objectives - you can always afford it with your economy. Be
proactive with people about coordinating tech acquisition - ask what
they’re planning to research, offer breakthrough deals, and work
together to ensure everyone gets what they need while you collect free
techs.</p>
<h2 id="vi.-strategy-cards">VI. Strategy Cards</h2>
<h3 id="a.-round-one">A. Round One</h3>
<p>Your R1 priority is flexible - grab value cards (Trade, Leadership)
and start executing your game plan.</p>
<p><strong>R1 Priority Ranking:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Trade</strong> - Solid economy. Flexible TGs to smooth
out early game.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leadership</strong> - Abuse tech skip breakthrough plays
with extra command tokens.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Construction</strong> - 3rd if no Warfare on table. Best
with blue tech path for tech skips.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Politics</strong> - Setup objective priority for round
2.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology</strong> - Not needed but always good
value.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Just for value but rough take and
helps all players.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Warfare</strong> - Free activation and move of tokens is
fine but not good/useful.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Imperial</strong> - Never round 1.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="b.-generally-r2">B. Generally (R2+)</h3>
<p><strong>Love:</strong> - <strong>Trade</strong> - Always good to make
people rich to give you more tech - <strong>Leadership</strong> -
Command token efficiency keeps you flexible</p>
<p><strong>Like:</strong> - <strong>Imperial</strong> - Points are the
goal. Your diplomatic positioning helps with Mecatol control -
<strong>Politics</strong> - 4 influence makes you politically relevant.
Agenda control matters</p>
<p><strong>Situational:</strong> - <strong>Technology</strong> - You’d
rather have others tech for you, but always good to tech a few things to
help with objectives or smooth out some stuff -
<strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Useful for protecting coexistence systems
or securing key positions - <strong>Construction</strong> - Extra
infrastructure when you need it</p>
<p><strong>Hate:</strong> - <strong>Warfare</strong> - Fleet token
return doesn’t align with your strategy</p>
<h2 id="vii.-intermediate">VII. Intermediate</h2>
<h3 id="a.-unit-composition">A. Unit Composition</h3>
<p>You’re not a military faction - focus on tech, economy, and infantry
spread for coexistence.</p>
<p><strong>Core Fleet:</strong> - <strong>Carriers</strong> - Transport
infantry to establish coexistence - <strong>Dreadnought</strong> - You
start with one for Sustain Damage and combat power -
<strong>Fighters</strong> - Absorb hits and screen</p>
<p><strong>Then add as needed:</strong> - <strong>Flagship</strong> -
Unique movement through contested systems if you have coexisting
infantry scattered - <strong>Destroyers</strong> - Combat support if
needed - <strong>Infantry</strong> - Your priority. Spread across the
galaxy for coexistence and ocean cards - <strong>Mechs</strong> -
PRODUCTION 1 allows local production on coexistence planets</p>
<p>Don’t over-invest in combat ships. Your strength is technological
superiority and economic advantage through ocean cards and commander
income, not military power.</p>
<h3 id="b.-game-plan">B. Game Plan</h3>
<p><strong>Strong Diplomatic Position:</strong></p>
<p>You have incredible diplomatic tools that make everyone want to be
your friend: - <strong>Share Knowledge (PN):</strong> Lend techs worth
at least 2 TG per turn - <strong>Breakthrough:</strong> Sell tech
research to the table for promissory notes - <strong>Commander:</strong>
Discount everyone’s tech research, generating passive income for you -
<strong>Coexistence:</strong> Lend planets to neighbors, sharing
resources/influence peacefully</p>
<p>This makes you extremely valuable to the table. Use this diplomatic
leverage to stay safe while building your economic and technological
advantages.</p>
<p><strong>Coexistence Network Strategy:</strong></p>
<p>Your primary game plan revolves around spreading infantry across
neighbor planets to establish coexistence relationships that generate
ocean cards.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1-2:</strong> CRITICAL - Unlock your commander
immediately. Use your agent (Doctor Carrina) on the Technology primary
player round 1 to place infantry in coexistence and gain your first
ocean card. This unlocks your commander, which generates passive income
every time anyone researches tech. Getting commander online round 1 is
essential to your economic engine. Expand safely with lots of ocean
cards for round 2 - your coexistence means you can share planets without
fighting.</p>
<p><strong>Round 3-4:</strong> With commander unlocked, every tech
research at the table generates commodities/trade goods for you. Now
incentivize people to tech with your breakthrough - offer promissory
notes back, sweeten deals, and make tech research attractive to the
table. The more they tech, the richer you become. Continue spreading
infantry through coexistence. Aim for 4-5 ocean cards by round 4. Stay
at pace with scoring - use your tech advantage to hit objectives
early.</p>
<p><strong>Round 5+:</strong> Use your tech and economic engine to score
otherwise hard to reach Stage 2 objectives. Your massive tech tree lets
you hit “Master the Sciences” objectives easily. Your economy (commander
income, ocean cards, Hydrothermal Mining) funds expensive plays. Your
coexistence network gives you access to planet types and diversity.</p>

<p>Scoring Stage II objectives is very possible for Deepwrought. Your
economic engine makes all spend objectives easy, and your tech
flexibility means you should be planning and preparing for Stage II
objectives throughout the game.</p>
<h2 id="ix.-alliance-priority">IX. Alliance Priority</h2>
<p>Alliance preference based on commander synergies with Deepwrought’s
entire kit:</p>
<p><strong>Top Tier:</strong> 1. <strong>Nekro Virus (Nekro
Acidos)</strong> - “After you gain a technology: You may draw 1 action
card” - You gain techs constantly via breakthrough. Turn tech
acquisition into action card generation. 2. <strong>Nomad (Navarch
Feng)</strong> - “You can produce your flagship without spending
resources” - Saves 8 resources. Always good value.</p>
<p><strong>Strong Tier:</strong> 3. <strong>Vuil’raith Cabal (That Which
Molds Flesh)</strong> - “When you produce infantry: Up to 2 of those
units do not count against PRODUCTION limit” - Extra infantry production
capacity for spreading coexistence network. 4. <strong>Xxcha (Elder
Qanoj)</strong> - “Each planet exhausted to vote provides 1 additional
vote” - Works with each of your ocean cards that provide influence.
Strong political multiplier. 5. <strong>Yssaril (So Ata)</strong> -
“After another player activates a system with your units: Look at their
action cards, promissory notes, or secret objectives” - You spread
everywhere with coexistence. Information is power for diplomatic plays.
Strong deterrent to remove your coexisting units and ocean cards. 6.
<strong>Federation of Sol (Claire Gibson)</strong> - “At the start of a
ground combat on a planet you control: Place 1 infantry from your
reinforcements on that planet” - Extra defensive infantry when your
coexistence planets are invaded. 7. <strong>Winnu (Rickar
Rickani)</strong> - “Apply +2 to combat rolls in Mecatol Rex, your home
system, and legendary planet systems” - Strong combat boost for key
battles and home defense. 8. <strong>Empyrean (Xuange)</strong> - “After
another player moves ships into a system with your command tokens:
Return that token to your reinforcements” - Command token efficiency for
sneaky invasion plays from coexisting positions.</p>
<h2 id="x.-end-notes">X. End Notes</h2>
<p>Deepwrought Scholarate is one of the most intellectually satisfying
factions in Twilight Imperium. Your coexistence mechanic creates a
completely unique relationship with the board where you’re
simultaneously present on enemy planets and non-threatening to their
control. This diplomatic flexibility, combined with your technological
superiority from 2 starting techs, makes you a faction that wins through
intelligence and adaptation.</p>
<p>The key to mastering Deepwrought is balancing your coexistence spread
with actual planet control. You need ocean cards for economy, but you
also need controlled planets for objectives. Finding the right balance -
spreading infantry for ocean cards while also securing planets you fully
control - is the core skill challenge.</p>
<p>Your biggest strength is flexibility. Radical Advancement lets you
swap technologies to adapt to objectives. Visionaria Select lets you
gain technologies for free while collecting promissory notes. Your
commander generates passive income. You have more economic engines than
almost any faction, giving you options other players don’t have.</p>
<p>When you nail Deepwrought, you feel like a grandmaster playing with
house rules. While opponents are locked into their tech paths, you’re
swapping technologies on the fly. While they’re fighting over planets,
you’re peacefully coexisting and reaping the economic benefits. Your
hero can delete critical technologies from the game, shutting down
entire strategies. Your flagship chains through contested space like
it’s ignoring the laws of physics.</p>
<p>Deepwrought Scholarate doesn’t conquer the galaxy through force -
they enlighten it through superior knowledge, then quietly score 10
points while everyone else is still figuring out how ocean cards
work.</p>
