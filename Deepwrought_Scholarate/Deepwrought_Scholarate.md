# Deepwrought Scholarate Guide

*Art credit: Fantasy Flight Games (Thunder's Edge)*

## I. Introduction

The Deepwrought Scholarate is TI4's coexistence and technology specialist, a faction that fundamentally reimagines how ground forces interact with planets. While other factions see invasion as winner-takes-all, you see it as an opportunity to establish shared research bases. You're the faction that can occupy enemy planets without controlling them, generate economic value from this coexistence, and use your technological superiority to outpace everyone at the table.

Your defining trait is the coexistence mechanic combined with ocean cards. When your ground forces begin coexisting on a planet (sharing it with another player's units), you gain ocean cards that provide various economic and strategic benefits. This creates a unique playstyle where you're incentivized to spread your infantry across the galaxy, establishing research outposts on planets you don't fully control.

The Deepwrought Scholarate excels at technological advancement, economic generation through ocean cards, and diplomatic flexibility. You start by researching 2 technologies during setup, giving you the strongest tech start in the entire game. Your faction technologies let you swap techs for better ones and generate trade goods from your ocean cards. You're not the strongest militarily, but you're the smartest - and intelligence wins wars.

## II. Playstyle

The Deepwrought philosophy is peaceful coexistence combined with technological supremacy. You're a diplomatic powerhouse - nobody hates the friendly techy fish who helps everyone research technologies and peacefully coexists on planets. Until it's too late, and the fish has been so well fed through passive income and technological advantages that they're ready to win the game.

Early game Deepwrought focuses on maximizing your starting technology advantage. You research 2 techs during setup, giving you a massive head start. You want to identify which technologies will best support your game plan and grab them immediately. Simultaneously, you spread infantry to establish coexistence on neighbor planets, building goodwill while generating ocean cards.

Mid-game transitions into ocean card economy and technology trading. Your agent helps allies research tech while placing your infantry in coexistence, spreading your presence further. Your commander generates passive income whenever others research, creating a snowball effect - the more you help the table tech, the richer you become.

Late game Deepwrought is about technological dominance and Radical Advancement value. By now, you should have a robust tech tree and be swapping technologies to get exactly what you need. Your hero can delete critical technologies from opponents' arsenals, shutting down their strategies. Your flagship's unique movement ability lets you navigate contested space. Most importantly, your "friendly fish" reputation should have kept you safe while you built an insurmountable advantage.

## III. The Basics

### A. Home System & Commodities

**Home System:** Ikatena
- 4 resources / 4 influence
- **Total: 2 optimal resources / 2 optimal influence**

**Commodities:** 3

Your home system is 4/4, but you can only spend resources from one of the two planets at a time (2/2 optimal). However, this is still very strong and easy to defend with both planets in the same system. The 4 influence is valuable for the agenda phase.

### B. Starting Fleet
- 1 Dreadnought
- 1 Carrier (capacity 6)
- 4 Fighters
- 3 Infantry
- 1 Space Dock

You start with a dreadnought, which gives you strong early combat capability and Sustain Damage. However, you only have 3 infantry, which limits your ability to establish widespread coexistence relationships early. You'll need to produce more infantry quickly to maximize your ocean card economy.

### C. Starting Tech

**During Setup, research Technology twice**

This is the strongest starting tech advantage in the game. You can research ANY two technologies, but must respect prerequisites (you need blue to get second blue, etc.). Your main paths:

**Blue Path:**
- **Antimass Deflectors + Dark Energy Tap (or Gravity Drive):** Movement flexibility and economy, sets up Fleet Logistics or Lightwave Deflector

**Green Path:**
- **Neural Motivator + Bio-Stims:** Command token efficiency plus fighter production boost, path to breakthrough unlock. Then use Radical Advancement to swap Bio-Stims for Hyper Metabolism later for token economy

### D. Faction Abilities

**Research Team:** When ground forces are committed, if your units on that planet are not already coexisting, you may choose for your units to coexist.

This is your core mechanic and it's insanely valuable. Instead of invading planets normally, you can choose to coexist. Your infantry shares the planet with the owner's units without triggering invasion combat. Both players can use the planet's resources/influence, but only the original controller truly "controls" it for objective purposes.

**Key Strategic Value:** Coexistence means you don't fully lose planets when invaded - you keep access to the resources/influence even if you're not the controller. Most importantly, coexisting on your home system planets means you still count as "controlling" your home system for scoring purposes, which is almost broken strong. You can be invaded and still score home system objectives.

**Oceanbound:** When your units begin coexisting on a planet, gain an ocean card and ready it. Any time you have more ocean cards than there are planets that contain your coexisting units, discard ocean cards until you do not.

Ocean cards provide various benefits (resources, influence, trade goods, movement, etc.) and **come into play readied**. This is crucial: whenever you have exhausted ocean cards, you should be looking for coexistence opportunities because the new ocean card comes in ready, giving you immediate value. Ocean cards are the engine that funds your strategy.

### E. Leaders

**Agent - Doctor Carrina:** When another player researches a technology, you may exhaust this card to allow that player to ignore 1 prerequisite. If they do, you may place 1 infantry from your reinforcements into coexistence on a non-home planet they control.

This is diplomatic gold and should be used ASAP every tech round. Ideally, use it on the Technology primary player (round 1) so everyone at the table can benefit from the prerequisite ignore, making you extremely popular while spreading your infantry into coexistence. Once your commander unlocks, all this tech research generates commodities/trade goods for you - you're literally getting paid to help people.

**Commander - Aello:**
- **Unlock:** Have an ocean card in play
- **Ability:** When another player spends resources to research a technology, that player may reduce the cost by 1. If they do, gain 1 commodity or convert 1 of your commodities to a trade good.

Your commander unlocks extremely early (as soon as you have 1 ocean card) and generates passive income whenever anyone researches tech. Since tech research happens constantly, you're generating 3-5 commodities/trade goods per round just by existing. The table won't notice the corruption of cheap tech until it's too late - they're happy getting discounted research while you're quietly building an insurmountable economic advantage.

**Hero - Ta Zern:**
- **Unlock:** Have 3 scored objectives
- **Wave Function Collapse:** Purge this card and a non-unit upgrade technology you own or from your deck. Then, purge all cards with the same name owned by other players and in other players' decks. Then, each player that purged a technology they owned researches another technology.

This hero is a bit weak overall, but picking the right tech at the right timing can absolutely win games. Delete Gravity Drive from the player threatening to take Mecatol, purge Fleet Logistics from someone setting up a double-activation power play, or remove a critical unit upgrade before a key combat. The key is timing - use it when removing a specific tech swings the game state in your favor.

### F. Promissory Note

**Share Knowledge:** Place this card faceup in your play area and gain 1 non-faction, non-unit upgrade technology that the Deepwrought player owns. Place that technology on this card. Return that technology to the deck and this card to the Deepwrought player at the end of the status phase.

This is worth at least 2 TG every turn and you should sell it as much as possible. Be proactive - look for what people need. Someone needs Hyper Metabolism for infantry? Sell them Share Knowledge for a command token or trade goods. Someone needs Sarween Tools? That's worth even more. Since you research 2 techs at setup and have access to a diverse tech tree, you'll almost always have something valuable to lend. This promissory note is a constant income stream - treat it like a renewable resource.

### G. Alliance

When a player researches a technology, they may choose to apply your commander's discount, your ally's commander's discount, or both if they want - it's always applicable.

Since you can never deny someone from using your commander discount anyway, the alliance primarily helps relations with whoever has your alliance card. It ensures your ally always has guaranteed access to tech discounts (and players can stack both discounts if applicable) and creates a strong diplomatic bond. This is more about cementing a key friendship than restricting the table.

### H. Mech

**Eanautic:** Cost 2, Combat 6, Sustain Damage, PRODUCTION 1

When another player activates this system, if this unit is coexisting, you may move it and any of your infantry on its planet to a planet you control in your home system.

Your mechs have PRODUCTION 1 and can retreat to safety when enemies activate the system where they're coexisting. This makes them defensive coexistence anchors that produce units while sitting on enemy planets.

### I. Flagship

**D.W.S. Luminous:** Cost 8, Combat 7 (x2), Move 1, Capacity 6, Sustain Damage

This ship can move through systems that contain your units, even if other players' units are present. If it would, apply +1 to its move value for each of those systems.

Your flagship can move through contested systems as long as you have units there. If you have coexisting infantry scattered across the galaxy, your flagship can chain through these systems, gaining +1 movement for each. This can result in 4-5 movement in a single activation.

### J. Breakthrough

**Visionaria Select:** Y<>G (Yellow-Green synergy)

**ACTION:** Exhaust this card to allow each other player to spend 3 trade goods and give you 1 promissory note. Each player that does may research a non-faction, non-unit upgrade technology. You also gain each technology researched in this way.

Look, people are gonna see this as poison after one game against Deepwrought. They're not stupid. So you gotta sweeten the deal - offer back promissory notes, maybe split the cost (PN back plus you pay 1 TG for techs you actually want). If you can get 3 players to bite, you're getting 3 free technologies. Having access to every tech in the game? Pretty, pretty, pretty good.

### K. Slice Considerations

You really want your faction breakthrough, so position can have some importance for accessing those tech skips. But damn if this faction isn't easy to slice with - it's probably the most flexible faction in the game. Any high value and safe slice will do you good.

**Prioritize Point-Scoring Slices:**
Since you're so flexible with tech and economy, focus on slices that help you score objectives:
- 4+ planets of one type (cultural/hazardous/industrial) for Stage II objectives - less critical because coexistence lets you access neighbor planets, but always helpful
- Anomalies for "control 2 anomalies" objectives
- 6+ total planets within reach for "control 6 planets" objectives
- High total value planets for "spend X resources/influence" objectives
- Tech skips are nice but not critical - most likely people will give you techs to smooth out any tech plan

**What Works:**
- Pretty much anything that's not total garbage
- You start with 2 techs, so you're not desperate for tech skips
- Coexistence means you can spread to neighbor planets anyway
- Your economic engines (ocean cards, commander, Hydrothermal Mining) work anywhere
- Your massive tech advantage and economy will find a way

**Avoid:**
- Very low total value slices (you need production capacity and planet value)
- Isolated slices with no neighbor contact (you need coexistence opportunities)

**Speaker Priority:** Flexible (any position works)

You're very flexible with speaker order. Just grab value strategy cards (Trade, Leadership, Technology) and you'll make it work. You're not desperate for any particular card or position.

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

### A. First Turn Priorities

Your Round 1 (R1) priority order:
1. **Score** - Flexible start, so get started on points early
2. **Breakthrough** - Get the tech train started via cheaper tech acquisition (better than researching normally)
3. **Produce and Expand** - Add expansion capability to be more flexible in round 2
4. **Tech** - Probably not needed since you already start with 2 techs and can use breakthrough for future research

**Expansion Notes:** You start with 1 dreadnought, 1 carrier, 4 fighters, and 3 infantry. Strong starting fleet for expansion with early Sustain Damage. Focus on taking 2-3 systems R1 while positioning near neighbors to establish coexistence opportunities. Your 3 infantry limit expansion - you'll need to produce more infantry to continue taking planets.

**Strategy Token Priority:** Diplomacy, Warfare, and whatever you need for scoring

### B. Coexistence Vulnerability

Your ocean card economy depends on maintaining coexistence. If opponents fully invade planets where you're coexisting, you lose those ocean cards. This makes you vulnerable to aggressive ground combat.

**Mitigation:**
- Maintain friendly relations with players you're coexisting with

### C. Combat Weakness

You have no combat bonuses or special combat abilities. However, this weakness isn't as bad as it seems - you'll have tons of upgraded units and tech advantages that compensate.

**Mitigation:**
- Your technological superiority means you get unit upgrades much earlier than opponents
- Avoid unnecessary fights - use coexistence instead of invasion when possible
- Use diplomacy and Share Knowledge to build alliances
- Your flagship can move through systems with your units, enabling repositioning when needed

## V. Technology

### A. Starting Technologies

**Research 2 technologies during setup (must respect prerequisites)**

This is the strongest starting tech advantage in the game. Focus on blue or green paths:

**Blue Path (Most Common):**
- **Dark Energy Tap (or Antimass Deflectors) + Gravity Drive:** Gives slice flexibility with increased movement

**Green Path:**
More economic but less flexible.
- **Neural Motivator + Bio-Stims:** Command token efficiency plus fighter production boost, path to breakthrough unlock. Then use Radical Advancement to swap Bio-Stims for Hyper Metabolism later for token economy
- **Neural Motivator + Radical Advancement:** Get your faction tech immediately for tech swapping flexibility

### B. Technology Acquisition Strategy

Deepwrought plays tech differently than any other faction. You acquire most techs from other players via your breakthrough ability, but can only research unit upgrades and faction techs yourself.

**Research These Yourself:**

*Unit Upgrades:*
- Carrier II (core)
- Dreadnought II (core)
- Destroyer II (solid combat option)
- Fighter II (if needed)
- War Sun (filthy rich fun option)

*Faction Techs:*
- Hydrothermal Mining - Very solid, generates 1 TG per ocean card each status phase
- Radical Advancement - Mostly situational since you'll have many techs; use to swap for specific objectives

**Get Via Breakthrough:**

Your breakthrough lets players pay 3 TG and give you a PN to research tech, and you copy whatever they research. The key is making this attractive - offer their PN back if you don't already have the tech they're researching, or even sweeten the deal by giving back PN + 1 TG to offset their tech cost. This turns breakthrough from "obviously helping Deepwrought too much" into "actually a pretty good deal."

*Blue:*
- Antimass Deflectors - Offer PN back
- Dark Energy Tap - Offer PN back
- Sling Relay - Willing to pay
- Gravity Drive - Willing to pay
- Fleet Logistics - Willing to pay
- Lightwave Deflector - Willing to pay

*Yellow:*
- Sarween Tools - Offer PN back
- Scanlink Drone Network - Offer PN back
- Graviton Laser System - Offer PN back
- Predictive Intelligence - Offer PN back
- Transit Diodes - Willing to pay
- Integrated Economy - Offer PN back

*Red:*
- Plasma Scoring - Offer PN back
- AI Development Algorithm - Offer PN back
- Magen Defense Grid - Offer PN back
- Self-Assembly Routines - Offer PN back
- Duranium Armor - Willing to pay
- Assault Cannon - Willing to pay

*Green:*
- Neural Motivator - Offer PN back if not starting tech
- Bio-Stims - Willing to pay
- Hyper Metabolism - Willing to pay
- X-89 Bacterial Weapon - Willing to pay
- Psychoarchaeology - Low priority
- Dacxive Animators - Low priority

**Note on Tech Flexibility:**
You have incredible tech flexibility. Never be afraid to research a tech yourself if it helps with scoring objectives - you can always afford it with your economy. Be proactive with people about coordinating tech acquisition - ask what they're planning to research, offer breakthrough deals, and work together to ensure everyone gets what they need while you collect free techs.

## VI. Strategy Cards

### A. Round 1

Your Round 1 (R1) priority is flexible - grab value cards (Trade, Leadership) and start executing your game plan.

**Round 1 Priority Ranking:**

1. **Trade** - Solid economy. Flexible TGs to smooth out early game.

2. **Leadership** - Abuse tech skip breakthrough plays with extra command tokens.

3. **Construction** - 3rd if no Warfare on table. Best with blue tech path for tech skips.

4. **Politics** - Setup objective priority for round 2.

5. **Technology** - Not needed but always good value.

6. **Diplomacy** - Just for value but rough take and helps all players.

7. **Warfare** - Free activation and move of tokens is fine but not good/useful.

8. **Imperial** - Never round 1.

### B. Generally (R2+)

**Love:**
- **Trade** - Always good to make people rich to give you more tech
- **Leadership** - Command token efficiency keeps you flexible

**Like:**
- **Imperial** - Points are the goal. Your diplomatic positioning helps with Mecatol control
- **Politics** - 4 influence makes you politically relevant. Agenda control matters

**Situational:**
- **Technology** - You'd rather have others tech for you, but always good to tech a few things to help with objectives or smooth out some stuff
- **Diplomacy** - Useful for protecting coexistence systems or securing key positions
- **Construction** - Extra infrastructure when you need it

**Hate:**
- **Warfare** - Fleet token return doesn't align with your strategy

## VII. Intermediate

### A. Unit Composition

You're not a military faction - focus on tech, economy, and infantry spread for coexistence.

**Core Fleet:**
- **Carriers** - Transport infantry to establish coexistence
- **Dreadnought** - You start with one for Sustain Damage and combat power
- **Fighters** - Absorb hits and screen

**Then add as needed:**
- **Flagship** - Unique movement through contested systems if you have coexisting infantry scattered
- **Destroyers** - Combat support if needed
- **Infantry** - Your priority. Spread across the galaxy for coexistence and ocean cards
- **Mechs** - PRODUCTION 1 allows local production on coexistence planets

Don't over-invest in combat ships. Your strength is technological superiority and economic advantage through ocean cards and commander income, not military power.

### B. Game Plan

**Strong Diplomatic Position:**

You have incredible diplomatic tools that make everyone want to be your friend:
- **Share Knowledge (PN):** Lend techs worth at least 2 TG per turn
- **Breakthrough:** Sell tech research to the table for promissory notes
- **Commander:** Discount everyone's tech research, generating passive income for you
- **Coexistence:** Lend planets to neighbors, sharing resources/influence peacefully

This makes you extremely valuable to the table. Use this diplomatic leverage to stay safe while building your economic and technological advantages.

**Coexistence Network Strategy:**

Your primary game plan revolves around spreading infantry across neighbor planets to establish coexistence relationships that generate ocean cards.

**Round 1-2:** CRITICAL - Unlock your commander immediately. Use your agent (Doctor Carrina) on the Technology primary player round 1 to place infantry in coexistence and gain your first ocean card. This unlocks your commander, which generates passive income every time anyone researches tech. Getting commander online round 1 is essential to your economic engine. Expand safely with lots of ocean cards for round 2 - your coexistence means you can share planets without fighting.

**Round 3-4:** With commander unlocked, every tech research at the table generates commodities/trade goods for you. Now incentivize people to tech with your breakthrough - offer promissory notes back, sweeten deals, and make tech research attractive to the table. The more they tech, the richer you become. Continue spreading infantry through coexistence. Aim for 4-5 ocean cards by round 4. Stay at pace with scoring - use your tech advantage to hit objectives early.

**Round 5+:** Use your tech and economic engine to score otherwise hard to reach Stage 2 objectives. Your massive tech tree lets you hit "Master the Sciences" objectives easily. Your economy (commander income, ocean cards, Hydrothermal Mining) funds expensive plays. Your coexistence network gives you access to planet types and diversity.

Scoring Stage II objectives is very possible for Deepwrought. Your economic engine makes all spend objectives easy, and your tech flexibility means you should be planning and preparing for Stage II objectives throughout the game.

## IX. Alliance Priority

Alliance preference based on commander synergies with Deepwrought's entire kit:

**Top Tier:**
1. **Nekro Virus (Nekro Acidos)** - "After you gain a technology: You may draw 1 action card" - You gain techs constantly via breakthrough. Turn tech acquisition into action card generation.
2. **Nomad (Navarch Feng)** - "You can produce your flagship without spending resources" - Saves 8 resources. Always good value.

**Strong Tier:**
3. **Vuil'raith Cabal (That Which Molds Flesh)** - "When you produce infantry: Up to 2 of those units do not count against PRODUCTION limit" - Extra infantry production capacity for spreading coexistence network.
4. **Xxcha (Elder Qanoj)** - "Each planet exhausted to vote provides 1 additional vote" - Works with each of your ocean cards that provide influence. Strong political multiplier.
5. **Yssaril (So Ata)** - "After another player activates a system with your units: Look at their action cards, promissory notes, or secret objectives" - You spread everywhere with coexistence. Information is power for diplomatic plays. Strong deterrent to remove your coexisting units and ocean cards.
6. **Federation of Sol (Claire Gibson)** - "At the start of a ground combat on a planet you control: Place 1 infantry from your reinforcements on that planet" - Extra defensive infantry when your coexistence planets are invaded.
7. **Winnu (Rickar Rickani)** - "Apply +2 to combat rolls in Mecatol Rex, your home system, and legendary planet systems" - Strong combat boost for key battles and home defense.
8. **Empyrean (Xuange)** - "After another player moves ships into a system with your command tokens: Return that token to your reinforcements" - Command token efficiency for sneaky invasion plays from coexisting positions.

## X. End Notes

Deepwrought Scholarate is one of the most intellectually satisfying factions in Twilight Imperium. Your coexistence mechanic creates a completely unique relationship with the board where you're simultaneously present on enemy planets and non-threatening to their control. This diplomatic flexibility, combined with your technological superiority from 2 starting techs, makes you a faction that wins through intelligence and adaptation.

The key to mastering Deepwrought is balancing your coexistence spread with actual planet control. You need ocean cards for economy, but you also need controlled planets for objectives. Finding the right balance - spreading infantry for ocean cards while also securing planets you fully control - is the core skill challenge.

Your biggest strength is flexibility. Radical Advancement lets you swap technologies to adapt to objectives. Visionaria Select lets you gain technologies for free while collecting promissory notes. Your commander generates passive income. You have more economic engines than almost any faction, giving you options other players don't have.

When you nail Deepwrought, you feel like a grandmaster playing with house rules. While opponents are locked into their tech paths, you're swapping technologies on the fly. While they're fighting over planets, you're peacefully coexisting and reaping the economic benefits. Your hero can delete critical technologies from the game, shutting down entire strategies. Your flagship chains through contested space like it's ignoring the laws of physics.

Deepwrought Scholarate doesn't conquer the galaxy through force - they enlighten it through superior knowledge, then quietly score 10 points while everyone else is still figuring out how ocean cards work.
