---

## I. Introduction

The Embers of Muaat is TI4's war sun faction, built around the most powerful ship in the game. This faction excels at overwhelming force, supernova mobility, and turning their massive war sun into a mobile production platform. Muaat isn't about subtlety—it's about deploying the galaxy's most feared warship and crushing opposition through sheer firepower.

The payoff? Watching opponents realize they can't contest your war sun, seeing their fleets crumble under BOMBARDMENT 3 (x3), and dominating through overwhelming combat superiority. When Muaat shows up with a war sun, the galaxy trembles.

## II. Playstyle

Playing Embers of Muaat is like commanding a superweapon. Your Prototype War Sun starts on the board R1, giving you immediate combat dominance. Your Star Forge ability lets you spend strategy tokens to produce fighters or destroyers near your war suns, turning them into mobile factories. Your Gashlai Physiology lets your ships move through supernovas, giving you unique mobility options.

The key strength of Muaat is war sun dominance. Use your war sun to control key systems, leverage Star Forge for unit production, and upgrade to Prototype War Sun II for move 3 mobility. You win through overwhelming force and strategic positioning.

Opponents will fear your war sun. That moment when they realize they can't defend against BOMBARDMENT 3 (x3) and 3 combat dice at 3+? Pure dominance.

## III. The Basics

### A. Home System & Commodities

**Home System:**
- **Muaat:** 4 resources / 1 influence
- **Total: 4 resources / 1 influence (4 optimal resources / 0 optimal influence)**

**Commodities:** 4

**Notes:** Resource-heavy single-planet home system with almost no influence. The 4 resources are perfect for war sun production (cost 12). The 4 commodities give you excellent trade potential—highest in the game.

### B. Starting Fleet

- 1 War Sun (Prototype War Sun I)
- 2 Fighters
- 4 Infantry
- 1 Space Dock

**Notes:** The only faction that starts with a war sun. This gives you massive combat power R1. The 4 infantry let you take planets, and 2 fighters provide screening. Your starting fleet is incredibly strong but expensive to move—war sun has move 1.

### C. Starting Technologies

- **Plasma Scoring (Red)** - When 1 or more of your units use BOMBARDMENT or SPACE CANNON, 1 of those units may roll 1 additional die.

**Notes:** Red starting tech opens red tech paths. Plasma Scoring synergizes perfectly with your war sun's BOMBARDMENT 3 (x3)—you can roll an additional die, making it BOMBARDMENT 3 (x4). Devastating for ground invasions.

### D. Faction Abilities

**Star Forge:** ACTION: Spend 1 token from your strategy pool to place either 2 fighters or 1 destroyer from your reinforcements in a system that contains 1 or more of your war suns.

Mobile production around your war suns. Spend a strategy token = instant fighters or destroyer. This makes your war suns into production platforms—you don't need space docks near them. Critical for reinforcing your fleets on the move.

**Gashlai Physiology:** Your ships can move through supernovas.

Unique mobility. Supernovas normally destroy ships, but yours can pass through them safely. This creates shortcuts across the map and gives you access to systems others can't reach. With Magmus Reactor tech, supernovas become PRODUCTION 5 zones for you.

### E. Leaders

**Agent - Umbat:** ACTION: Exhaust this card to choose a player; that player may produce up to 2 units that each have a cost of 4 or less in a system that contains one of their war suns or their flagship.

Useful for helping allies or yourself produce units near war suns/flagships. Cost 4 or less = dreadnoughts, cruisers, carriers, destroyers, fighters, infantry, mechs. Good diplomatic tool or self-boost.

**Commander - Magmus:** *Unlock: Produce a war sun.*

After you spend a token from your strategy pool: You may gain 1 trade good.

Easy unlock for Muaat (you start with a war sun, just need to produce one more). Once unlocked, every time you spend a strategy token (Star Forge, abilities, etc.), you gain 1 TG. This turns strategy token spending into economic advantage—you make money from using Star Forge.

**Hero - Adjudicator Ba'al:** *Unlock: Have 3 scored objectives.*

**Nova Seed** - After you move a war sun into a non-home system other than Mecatol Rex: You may destroy all other players' units in that system and replace that system tile with the Muaat supernova tile. If you do, purge this card and each planet card that corresponds to the replaced system tile.

Ultimate weapon. Move your war sun into an enemy system → destroy everything and replace the entire system with a supernova. This removes planets from the game permanently. Save for critical moments when eliminating an opponent's key system wins you the game. Devastating psychological weapon.

### F. Promissory Note - **Fires of the Gashlai**

ACTION: Remove 1 token from the Muaat player's fleet pool and return it to his reinforcements. Then, gain your war sun unit upgrade technology card. Then, return this card to the Muaat Player.

Incredibly strong PN. Gives another player YOUR war sun technology (they can build war suns). The cost is reducing Muaat's fleet pool by 1 permanently (until returned). Trade value: 5-6 TG minimum. Only trade this to players who can afford war suns (high resources) and who you trust won't use them against you.

### G. Mech - **Ember Colossus**

Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | **Sustain Damage**

When you use your Star Forge faction ability in this system or an adjacent system, you may place 1 infantry from your reinforcements with this unit.

Synergizes with Star Forge. When you use Star Forge to produce fighters/destroyers, you can also place an infantry with your mech. This helps build ground forces without production. Sustain Damage makes it durable.

### H. Flagship - **The Inferno**

Cost: 8 | Combat: 5 (x2) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 3 | **Sustain Damage**

ACTION: Spend 1 token from your strategy pool to place 1 cruiser in this unit's system.

Your flagship extends Star Forge to cruisers. Spend a strategy token → instant cruiser. This gives you production flexibility beyond fighters/destroyers. Cruisers (cost 2, combat 7, move 2) are solid ships. The flagship becomes a mobile cruiser factory.

### I. Breakthrough - **Stellar Genesis (R<>Y)**

When you gain this card, place the Avernus planet token into a non-home system that is adjacent to a planet you control; gain control of and ready it. After you move 1 of your war suns out of or through Avernus's system and into a non-home system, you may move the Avernus token with it.

**Avernus:** 2 resources / 0 influence (Legendary Planet)
**Legendary Ability - The Nucleus:** ACTION: Exhaust this card to use the Embers of Muaat's STAR FORGE faction ability without spending a command token.

**R<>Y Synergy:** Red and yellow technologies count as each other for prerequisites.

Creates a legendary planet (Avernus) that moves with your war sun. Avernus gives you 2 resources and its legendary ability lets you use Star Forge for FREE (no command token cost). This is massive—unlimited fighter/destroyer production near your war sun.

**R<>Y synergy:** Opens red and yellow tech paths flexibly.

### J. Slice and Draft Considerations

Muaat wants resources and supernova access. Your priorities:

**Speaker Order:**
- **Prefer early positions (1-3)** - Lets you grab Trade or Leadership early to fuel your expensive war sun economy.

**Slice Priorities:**
- **High resources** - Your home system has 4 resources, but war suns cost 12. You need 8+ additional resources to produce a second war sun. Look for resource-heavy slices (8-10 resources total).
- **Supernova access (if available)** - If the map has supernovas, position yourself to access them with Gashlai Physiology. With Magmus Reactor, supernovas become PRODUCTION 5 zones.
- **Central positioning** - Your war sun is slow (move 1 initially). You want to be centrally located to project power across the map.
- **No need for tech skips** - Your tech path works with R<>Y synergy from Stellar Genesis. Tech skips are nice but not necessary.

**Slice Features to Avoid:**
- **Low resources (5-6 total)** - You can't afford war sun production without high resources.
- **Isolated slice** - Your war sun moves slowly. Being isolated limits your ability to threaten opponents.

**Summary:**
Muaat needs high resources for war sun production, central positioning for map control, and optionally supernova access for mobility. Resources are your top priority—you need at least 8-10 total resources to function.

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

### A. First Turn Priorities

Your R1 priority order: **Trade > Leadership > Technology**

Focus on:
1. **Trade** - You have 4 commodities (highest in game). Trade agreements are critical for your economy.
2. **Leadership** - Command tokens for Star Forge (spend strategy tokens to produce units). You need tokens to leverage your abilities.
3. **Technology** - Get started on your tech path (Prototype War Sun II is your goal).

**Expansion Notes:** You have 1 war sun, 2 fighters, and 4 infantry. Your war sun is slow (move 1) and expensive to lose. Expand cautiously R1—take 2-3 nearby planets with your infantry. Don't overextend your war sun. Your goal is to secure resources and build towards a second war sun or tech upgrades.

### B. War Sun Dependence

Your entire strategy revolves around your war sun. If you lose it, you're crippled. War suns cost 12 resources to replace—losing one is devastating. Always protect your war sun with supporting ships (fighters, destroyers, cruisers). Never send it into combat alone.

### C. Slow Mobility (Pre-Upgrade)

Your war sun starts with move 1. This makes it slow to project power across the map. You're vulnerable to faster factions that can outmaneuver you. Your priority is getting Prototype War Sun II (move 3) to solve this weakness.

### D. Expensive Economy

War suns cost 12 resources. Star Forge costs strategy tokens. Prototype War Sun II costs RRRY (4 techs). Everything about Muaat is expensive. You need strong trade agreements (4 commodities help) and high resource income to sustain your game plan.

---

## V. Technology

### A. Overview

You start with **Plasma Scoring (R)**.

Your main tech path focuses on:
1. **Prototype War Sun II (RRRY)** - Upgraded war sun with move 3 and cost 10
2. **Magmus Reactor (RR)** - Ships move into supernovas, supernovas get PRODUCTION 5
3. **Stellar Genesis breakthrough (R<>Y)** - Creates Avernus legendary planet

### B. Recommended Tech Paths

**Path 1: War Sun Upgrade Rush**
1. Plasma Scoring (R) - Starting tech
2. Magen Defense Grid (R-R) - R2
3. Duranium Armor (R-R) - R3
4. Sarween Tools (Y) - R3-4
5. Prototype War Sun II (R-R-R-Y) - R4 *faction tech*
6. Magmus Reactor (R-R) - R5 *faction tech*

This path rushes Prototype War Sun II (move 3, cost 10) as fast as possible. The mobility upgrade is critical—moving from 1 to 3 movement transforms your war sun from slow to dominant. Prioritize this above all else.

**Path 2: Economic Support**
1. Plasma Scoring (R) - Starting tech
2. Sarween Tools (Y) - R2
3. Magen Defense Grid (R-R) - R3
4. AI Development Algorithm (Y-Y) - R3-4
5. Prototype War Sun II (R-R-R-Y) - R4-5 *faction tech*
6. Stellar Genesis (R<>Y) - R5-6 *breakthrough*

This path adds economic techs (Sarween, AI Dev) to support your expensive war sun economy before upgrading. Stellar Genesis creates Avernus legendary planet that moves with your war sun and provides free Star Forge uses.

**Path 3: Supernova Specialist**
1. Plasma Scoring (R) - Starting tech
2. Magmus Reactor (R-R) - R2 *faction tech*
3. Sarween Tools (Y) - R3
4. Magen Defense Grid (R-R) - R3-4
5. Prototype War Sun II (R-R-R-Y) - R4-5 *faction tech*
6. Stellar Genesis (R<>Y) - R5-6 *breakthrough*

This path prioritizes Magmus Reactor early (supernovas become PRODUCTION 5 zones). Only viable on maps with supernovas. Creates untouchable production zones in supernovas where opponents cannot follow.

### C. Key Technologies

**Must Get:**
- **Prototype War Sun II (R-R-R-Y):** Your #1 priority. Upgrades war sun to move 3 (from 1), cost 10 (from 12), combat 3 (from 5). The movement is critical—war suns go from immobile to map-dominating.
- **Sarween Tools (Y):** Economic efficiency. Saves 1 resource per production = 20-30 saved resources over game.
- **Magmus Reactor (R-R):** Your faction tech. Ships can move into supernovas. Supernovas gain PRODUCTION 5. Only valuable if map has supernovas.

**High Priority:**
- **Magen Defense Grid (R-R):** Your PDS get +1 die to Space Cannon. With Plasma Scoring, that's 2 additional dice. Helps defend home system.
- **AI Development Algorithm (Y-Y):** If you research multiple unit upgrades (War Sun II, Dreadnought II, Cruiser II), this pays for itself.
- **Duranium Armor (R-R):** All non-fighter ships gain +1 combat. Your war sun becomes combat 4, destroyers combat 8, cruisers combat 6. Strong combat boost.

**Solid Options:**
- **Stellar Genesis (R<>Y):** Breakthrough creating Avernus legendary planet. Moves with war sun. Legendary ability = free Star Forge uses (no token cost). Powerful late-game.
- **Destroyer II (R-R-B-B):** Move 2, combat 8, AFB 6 (x2). Good supporting ship.
- **Cruiser II (R-R-Y-Y):** Move 3, combat 6, capacity 1. Fast, affordable ship.

### D. Technology Timing

**Round 1:** No tech research (focus on Trade/Leadership)
**Round 2:** Research first red tech (Magen or Sarween depending on path)
**Round 3:** Continue toward 3 reds for Prototype War Sun II
**Round 4:** Research Prototype War Sun II if possible (this is the power spike)
**Round 5+:** Magmus Reactor or Stellar Genesis depending on map/strategy

## VI. Strategy Cards

### A. Round 1 Priority

1. **Trade** - You have 4 commodities. Trade agreements are critical for economy.
2. **Leadership** - Command tokens for Star Forge and expansion.
3. **Technology** - Get started on tech path toward Prototype War Sun II.
4. **Construction** - Build space docks for production capacity.
5. **Warfare** - Redeploy + free activation.
6. **Politics** - Agenda control.
7. **Diplomacy** - Rarely useful.
8. **Imperial** - Never R1.

### B. Round 2+ Priority

**Love:**
- **Trade** - Need trade good income for expensive economy.
- **Leadership** - Command tokens for Star Forge spam.

**Good:**
- **Technology** - Staying on tech path toward Prototype War Sun II.
- **Imperial** - MR points when ready.

**Situational:**
- **Construction** - Only if building more space docks.
- **Warfare** - If playing aggressively.

---

## VII. Intermediate

### A. Unit Composition

Your ideal fleet composition in each system:

**Minimum core:**
- **1 War Sun** - Your centerpiece. Provides overwhelming combat power.
- **2-4 Fighters** - Absorb hits and screen your war sun.
- **1-2 Destroyers or Cruisers** - Supporting ships for additional combat dice.

**Then add as needed:**
- **Infantry** - Ground forces for taking planets.
- **Mechs** - Deploy when using Star Forge nearby.

Your war sun is your priority. Always protect it with screening ships. Use Star Forge to produce fighters/destroyers around your war sun as it moves.

### B. Point Planning

**Muaat Christmas-Land Strategy Cards:**

| Round | Card       | Public Points | Secret Points | MR Points | Bonus | Total |
|-------|------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|-------|-------|
| One   | Trade      | 0             | 0             | 0         | 0     | 0     |
| Two   | Leadership | 1             | 0             | 0         | 0     | 1     |
| Three | Imperial   | 3             | 1             | 1         | 0     | 5     |
| Four  | Technology | 4             | 2             | 1         | 1     | 8     |
| Five  | Imperial   | 6             | 3             | 2         | 1     | 12    |

You can only score 1 public objective per round (2 if you have Imperial). When you take Imperial, you can double score publics. Aim to score all 3 secrets across the game.

**Notes:**
- Muaat scores with war sun objectives (Engineer a Marvel is free R1)
- Your war sun makes combat objectives easy
- Trade and Leadership R1-R2 build your economy, then Imperial R3 and R5

### C. Game Plan

**War Sun Dominance:**

Your game plan revolves around leveraging your war sun's overwhelming power:

1. **Secure Resources R1-R2** - Take planets to build resources for second war sun or tech path. You need 8-10 total resources minimum.

2. **Get Prototype War Sun II** - This is your top priority. Move 3 war sun changes everything—you can project power across the entire map. Without this upgrade, you're too slow.

3. **Build Second War Sun** - With Commander (Magmus) unlocked, producing a second war sun makes you nearly unstoppable. Two war suns = complete map control.

4. **Use Star Forge Aggressively** - Don't hoard strategy tokens. Use Star Forge to produce fighters/destroyers around your war sun constantly. With Commander, you gain 1 TG every time you spend a strategy token, so it pays for itself.

5. **Control Mecatol Rex** - Your war sun is the best ship for holding MR. Park it there with supporting ships and use Star Forge to reinforce. No one can dislodge you.

**Supernova Strategy (with Magmus Reactor):**

If you get Magmus Reactor tech:
- Supernovas become PRODUCTION 5 zones for you.
- Move ships into supernovas and produce units there.
- Use supernovas as shortcuts across the map (Gashlai Physiology).
- This creates untouchable production zones—opponents can't follow you into supernovas.

**Hero Timing:**

Save your hero (Adjudicator Ba'al - Nova Seed) for critical moments:
- Eliminating an opponent's home system or key resource base.
- Creating a supernova barrier between you and threats.
- Denying objectives that require specific planets.

Turning systems into supernovas is permanent—use it strategically.

## IX. Alliance Priority

Trading for other factions' Alliance promissory notes (which give you access to their Commanders) can significantly boost your strategy. Here are the top alliances to prioritize:

**Super Top Tier:**
1. **Titans of Ul (Tungstantus)** - When you use PRODUCTION, gain 1 trade good. Perfect synergy with constant production.
2. **Nomad (Navarch Feng)** - Produce flagship without spending resources. Always good value. Saves 8 resources.
3. **Jol-Nar (Ta Zern)** - Reroll dice for unit abilities. Reroll BOMBARDMENT on your war sun.

**Really Useful:**
4. **Winnu (Rickar Rickani)** - +2 combat in MR, your home system, and legendary systems. Your war sun becomes even more dominant.
5. **Arborec (Dirzuga Rophal)** - After another player activates system with your PRODUCTION units, produce 1 unit. Synergizes with Star Forge.

## X. End Notes

Embers of Muaat is TI4's war sun superpower. Your job is to:

1. **Protect your war sun** - It's your most valuable asset. Never lose it.
2. **Get Prototype War Sun II** - Move 3 war sun changes everything. Top priority.
3. **Secure high resources** - You need 8-10+ resources to produce war suns and sustain your economy.
4. **Use Star Forge constantly** - Spend strategy tokens to produce fighters/destroyers around your war sun. With Commander, you gain 1 TG per token spent.
5. **Build second war sun** - Two war suns = unstoppable map control.

Don't be afraid to use your war sun aggressively. It's the strongest ship in the game—opponents should fear it, not you. Leverage BOMBARDMENT 3 (x3) to crush ground defenses and dominate space combat with overwhelming firepower.
