<h2 id="i.-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>The L1Z1X Mindnet is Twilight Imperium’s <strong>premier dreadnought
faction</strong>. Deploy massive Super Dreadnoughts, unleash devastating
BOMBARDMENT against enemy ground forces, and conquer planets across the
galaxy. Your faction excels at territorial expansion through
overwhelming military force, stealing enemy infrastructure when you
conquer their worlds, and projecting unstoppable late-game power. L1Z1X
isn’t about subtle diplomacy—it’s about building the most terrifying
fleet in the galaxy and using it to dominate through conquest.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-playstyle">II. Playstyle</h2>
<p>Playing L1Z1X Mindnet is about methodical territorial expansion
backed by overwhelming military force. Build dreadnoughts, conquer
planets, steal enemy structures, and gradually expand your empire.</p>
<p>Early game you establish your production and build your dreadnought
fleet. Mid-game you unlock your Commander and start making aggressive
moves on fortified worlds. Late game you leverage your massive fleet to
make decisive swings across the map—teleporting fleets with your Hero,
conquering key planets, and securing objectives through military
superiority.</p>
<p>Once you take something, it was always yours.</p>
<h2 id="iii.-the-basics">III. The Basics</h2>
<h3 id="a.-home-system-commodities">A. Home System &amp;
Commodities</h3>
<p><strong>Home System:</strong> - <strong>[0.0.0]:</strong> 5 resources
/ 0 influence - <strong>Total: 5 resources / 0 influence (5 optimal
resources / 0 optimal influence)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> One of the strongest home systems in the
game. Easy to defend, and 5 resources provides great production for
dreadnoughts. Zero influence makes political gameplay difficult but
doesn’t matter for your military strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Commodities:</strong> 2</p>
<p>Low commodity count reflects your non-economic focus. You’re not a
trading faction.</p>
<h3 id="b.-starting-fleet">B. Starting Fleet</h3>
<p><strong>Fleet Composition:</strong> - 1 Dreadnought (Super
Dreadnought I) - 1 Carrier - 3 Fighters - 5 Infantry - 1 Space Dock - 1
PDS</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Very solid starting fleet. Having 5 infantry
and 2 ships with capacity (Super Dreadnought with capacity 2, Carrier
with capacity 6) gives you a solid start for expansion. Space dock and
PDS on your home planet are standard.</p>
<h3 id="c.-faction-abilities">C. Faction Abilities</h3>
<p><strong>Assimilate:</strong> <em>When you gain control of a planet,
replace each PDS and space dock that is on that planet with a matching
unit from your reinforcements.</em></p>
<p>Steal enemy structures when conquering planets. If your opponent has
a space dock on the planet you invade, you take it—no need to build your
own. Same for PDS. This is incredibly powerful for forward expansion.
Taking an enemy’s forward space dock gives you an instant production
facility deep in their territory.</p>
<p><strong>Harrow:</strong> <em>After each round of ground combat, your
ships in the active system may use their BOMBARDMENT abilities against
your opponent’s ground forces on the planet.</em></p>
<p>Game-changing invasion ability. Unlike normal BOMBARDMENT (which only
happens before invasion begins), Harrow lets you BOMBARDMENT after every
ground combat round. Here’s how it works:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Pre-invasion BOMBARDMENT (normal timing)</li>
<li>Round 1 of ground combat</li>
<li><strong>Harrow BOMBARDMENT</strong> (you roll BOMBARDMENT
again)</li>
<li>Round 2 of ground combat</li>
<li><strong>Harrow BOMBARDMENT</strong> (you roll again)</li>
<li>Continue until invasion ends</li>
</ol>
<p>This means a Super Dreadnought with BOMBARDMENT can potentially roll
multiple times during a single invasion, systematically destroying
ground forces. Combined with your mech’s BOMBARDMENT and Plasma Scoring
(+1 die to BOMBARDMENT), you can obliterate defenders without risking
your own infantry.</p>
<h3 id="d.-starting-and-faction-technologies">D. Starting and Faction
Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Technologies:</strong> - <strong>Neural
Motivator:</strong> <em>During the status phase, draw 2 action cards
instead of 1.</em> - <strong>Plasma Scoring:</strong> <em>When 1 or more
of your units use BOMBARDMENT or SPACE CANNON, 1 of those units may roll
1 additional die.</em></p>
<p><strong>Strategic Analysis:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Neural Motivator</strong> gives you action card advantage.
Draw 2 action cards every status phase instead of 1, giving you more
options and flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>Plasma Scoring</strong> boosts your BOMBARDMENT advantage.
Your Super Dreadnoughts benefit massively from rolling extra dice. This
also helps your PDS for SPACE CANNON defense.</p>
<p>These are not the tech colors we deserve, but what we got. Your Super
Dreadnought II is as far away as it is for the techless Sardakk.</p>
<p><strong>Faction Technologies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Super Dreadnought II (BBY):</strong> <em>L1Z1X Dreadnought -
Cost: 4 | Combat: 4 | Move: 2 | Capacity: 2 | BOMBARDMENT 4 | Sustain
Damage</em></p>
<p>This unit cannot be destroyed by “Direct Hit” action cards.</p>
<p>Upgraded version with better combat (4 instead of 5), Move 2 (instead
of 1), BOMBARDMENT 4 (instead of 5), and immunity to Direct Hit. The
mobility and Direct Hit immunity are game-changing.</p>
<p><strong>Inheritance Systems (YY):</strong> <em>You may exhaust this
card and spend 2 resources when you research a technology; ignore all of
that technology’s prerequisites.</em></p>
<p>Tech skip card. Exhaust and pay 2 resources to ignore prerequisites
when researching any tech. This lets you jump straight to high-tier
technologies without building up prerequisite chains.</p>
<h3 id="e.-leaders">E. Leaders</h3>
<p><strong>Agent - I48S:</strong> <em>After a player activates a system:
You may exhaust this card to allow that player to replace 1 of their
infantry in the active system with 1 mech from their
reinforcements.</em></p>
<p>Trade this to players who need mechs. Not particularly strong for you
since mechs aren’t your focus, but can be useful for making deals. You
can also use it yourself to deploy your mech.</p>
<p><strong>Commander - 2RAM:</strong> <em>Unlock: Have 4 dreadnoughts on
the game board. Units that have Planetary Shield do not prevent you from
using BOMBARDMENT.</em></p>
<p><strong>This is your key unlock.</strong> Planetary Shield (from
mechs, Magen Defense Grid tech, or faction abilities) normally prevents
BOMBARDMENT entirely. With 2RAM unlocked, you ignore this
restriction—you can BOMBARDMENT planets even if they have Planetary
Shield. This removes the primary counter to your strategy. Aim to unlock
Round 2-3 (R2-R3) by producing dreadnoughts early.</p>
<p><strong>Hero - The Helmsman:</strong> <em>Unlock: Have 3 scored
objectives.</em> <strong>Dark Space Navigation</strong> - ACTION: Choose
1 system that does not contain other players’ ships; you may move your
flagship and any number of your dreadnoughts from other systems into the
chosen system. Then, purge this card.</p>
<p>Teleport your dreadnought fleet across the galaxy. Use this for
surprise Mecatol Rex takes, defensive regrouping, or positioning for
critical objectives. The limitation (system cannot contain other
players’ ships) means you can’t use it for direct attacks, but you can
move to adjacent systems for next-turn strikes. Timing is crucial—save
this for Round 4-5 (R4-R5) when positioning wins games.</p>
<h3 id="f.-promissory-note---cybernetic-enhancements-ω">F. Promissory
Note - <strong>Cybernetic Enhancements Ω</strong></h3>
<p><em>When you gain command tokens during the status phase: Gain 1
additional command token. Then, return this card to the L1Z1X
player.</em></p>
<p>Gives a player +1 command token during status phase. Very
sellable—command tokens are always useful.</p>
<p>Trade value: 2 TG. First person to ask usually gets it. Don’t
undersell—this is worth the command token they would buy from Leadership
anyway.</p>
<h3 id="g.-alliance">G. Alliance</h3>
<p>Your alliance gives access to your Commander (2RAM). Players who take
your alliance can ignore Planetary Shield for BOMBARDMENT, which is
strong for invasion-focused factions. Trade this to military factions
(Sardakk, Barony, Sol) who benefit from BOMBARDMENT, or use it as
leverage in negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="h.-mech---annihilator">H. Mech -
<strong>Annihilator</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> 2</li>
<li><strong>Combat:</strong> 6</li>
<li><strong>Sustain Damage</strong></li>
<li><strong>BOMBARDMENT 8</strong></li>
<li><strong>Special:</strong> <em>While not participating in ground
combat, this unit can use its BOMBARDMENT ability on planets in its
system as if it were a ship.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>BOMBARDMENT from orbit.</strong> Your mech can BOMBARDMENT
planets in its system without landing. Important: once you commit your
mech to a planet for ground combat, you lose this ability.</p>
<p>In practice, mechs are usually better on the ground. Hitting on 6 and
soaking damage with Sustain Damage is more valuable than keeping them in
orbit for repeated BOMBARDMENT. Only leave mechs in orbit if you’re
trying to slowly siege a heavily defended planet without committing
ground forces.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Synergy:</strong> You’ll have your mechs out early
because of your Agent. Use I48S to replace one of your starting 5
infantry with a mech when you activate systems. This is why you start
with 5 infantry—to leave one behind and convert the other 4 into two
2-capacity ship loads.</p>
<h3 id="i.-flagship---0.0.1">I. Flagship - <strong>[0.0.1]</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> 8</li>
<li><strong>Combat:</strong> 5 (x2)</li>
<li><strong>Move:</strong> 1</li>
<li><strong>Capacity:</strong> 5</li>
<li><strong>Sustain Damage</strong></li>
<li><strong>Special:</strong> <em>During a space combat, hits produced
by this ship and by your dreadnoughts in this system must be assigned to
non-fighter ships if able.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Forces hits to be assigned to non-fighter ships. This bypasses
fighter screens—opponents must assign hits to carriers, cruisers, and
dreadnoughts first. Makes your fleet lethal at chewing through capital
ships, even when outnumbered by fighters.</p>
<p><strong>Defensive Value:</strong> Your flagship is an amazing
defensive tool. Wherever it sits, opponents can’t just send
carriers—they need real fleet power to challenge you. You’re more
incentivized to build and use your flagship than most factions.</p>
<p><strong>Win-Slaying:</strong> Combines with your Hero to teleport
your flagship + dreads for decisive Round 5 strikes.</p>
<h3 id="j.-breakthrough---fealty-uplink-rg">J. Breakthrough -
<strong>Fealty Uplink (R&lt;&gt;G)</strong></h3>
<p><em>When you gain control of a planet, place infantry from your
reinforcements equal to that planet’s influence value on that
planet.</em></p>
<p>When you conquer a planet, gain infantry equal to its influence
value. A 3-influence planet gives you 3 free infantry immediately. This
is strong for sustained invasions—you don’t need to transport infantry,
you generate them on conquest. The R&lt;&gt;G swap (red and green count
as each other for prerequisites) opens tech path flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>Unlock timing:</strong> Secure this Round 1 or not at all. If
you’re unlocking your breakthrough later, you’re probably not in an
invasion-focused game and should skip Fealty Uplink entirely.</p>
<h3 id="k.-slice-and-draft-considerations">K. Slice and Draft
Considerations</h3>
<p><strong>Speaker Position:</strong> Prefer 1-3 to secure breakthrough
and get value from good strategy cards (Technology, Diplomacy).</p>
<p><strong>Slice Preferences:</strong> - <strong>INFLUENCE-HEAVY SLICES
(CRITICAL)</strong> - You need influence to offset your 5/0 home system.
Command tokens require influence. Fealty Uplink breakthrough generates
infantry equal to influence value—high-influence planets = more free
infantry. Don’t fall into the trap of taking resource-heavy slices. You
need influence desperately. - <strong>Strong systems nearby home
system</strong> - Your dreadnoughts are slow (move 1 until upgraded) and
you lack mobility early. You need valuable systems adjacent or close to
home. Always nice to have a willing neighbor if Mecatol Rex is
unavailable. - <strong>High-value targets with structures</strong> -
Assimilate benefits from conquering planets that have space docks and
PDS. If your slice has neighbors with developed infrastructure, you can
steal it.</p>
<p><strong>Draft Considerations:</strong> - <strong>Tempesta
Legendary</strong> - Has to be nearby home system. Gives +1 movement to
ships (once per round). Solves your mobility problem early. -
<strong>Entropic</strong> - Turns you from a faction in trouble to a
faction that is trouble.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iv.-structural-weaknesses">IV. Structural Weaknesses</h2>
<h3 id="a.-first-turn-priorities">A. First Turn Priorities</h3>
<p>Your Round 1 (R1) is about establishing dreadnought production and
expansion. The priority order is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Breakthrough</strong> - Secure Round 1 or not at all.</li>
<li><strong>Scoring</strong> - Expand to score Stage I objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Technology</strong> - Get on your tech path early.</li>
<li><strong>Production &amp; Expansion</strong> - Build dreadnoughts and
grab planets.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Strategy Token Spending (Secondaries):</strong> -
<strong>Diplomacy secondary</strong> - Big value with your 5-resource
home system. - <strong>Technology secondary</strong> - Important to get
started on your tech path.</p>
<h3 id="b.-low-mobility-early">B. Low Mobility Early</h3>
<p>Your dreadnoughts start with move 1. This severely limits mobility
until you get Super Dreadnought II (move 2). You’ll struggle to reach
distant planets and Mecatol Rex quickly. Limits access to fractures
early. Gravity Drive helps but costs a blue tech. Plan your expansion
carefully—you can’t reposition easily.</p>
<h3 id="c.-influence-poverty">C. Influence Poverty</h3>
<p>Zero home influence cripples your command token economy. You can’t
spend influence to buy command tokens, which severely limits tactical
actions. This is your biggest economic weakness and must be addressed
through slice selection and early expansion.</p>
<p>Secondary issues: You can’t claim Mecatol Rex easily and have no
voting power during agendas.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="v.-technology">V. Technology</h2>
<h3 id="a.-overview">A. Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Technologies:</strong> - Neural Motivator - Draw 2
action cards instead of 1 during status phase - Plasma Scoring - +1 die
to BOMBARDMENT or SPACE CANNON - <strong>Note:</strong> Impactful in New
Age Path, kinda weak in Blue Path.</p>
<p><strong>Core Technologies:</strong> Gravity Drive, Super Dreadnought
II</p>
<p>L1Z1X is very tech-dependent. You need multiple technologies to make
your kit work. Successful L1Z1X games are the ones where people ask “Why
does L1 have so much tech?” -SCPT. Don’t be shy about investing in
technology—your faction thrives when you over-tech.</p>
<h3 id="b.-tech-path-1-blue-path-oldie-but-goldie">B. Tech Path 1: Blue
Path (Oldie but Goldie)</h3>
<p>The classic path. Unfortunately, it requires you to move to blue
without help from your starting techs. This path allows for higher
mobility and flexibility by paying with firepower—you’re investing in
movement and positioning rather than raw combat upgrades. You have to
double tech once during R1-R3.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A blue skip allows faster progression but can
be costly if you need to use it for every tech.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1:</strong> Dark Energy Tap - Retreat flexibility,
frontier exploration | OR Antimass Deflectors - Move through asteroids,
SPACE CANNON defense</p>
<p><strong>Round 2:</strong> Gravity Drive (B) - +1 move to one ship per
activation</p>
<p><strong>Round 3:</strong> AI Development Algorithm - Skip unit
upgrade prereqs, production cost reduction | AND Super Dreadnought II
(BBY) - Move 2, immune to Direct Hit</p>
<p><strong>Round 4:</strong> Fleet Logistics (BB) - 2 actions per turn |
OR Light/Wave Deflector (BBB) - Move through enemy systems | OR Carrier
II (BB) - Move 2, capacity 6</p>
<p><strong>Round 5:</strong> Fleet Logistics (BB) | Light/Wave Deflector
(BBB) | Carrier II (BB)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Destroyer II (RR) is a good 3rd unit upgrade
option for anti-fighter coverage.</p>
<h3 id="c.-tech-path-2-new-age-path">C. Tech Path 2: New Age Path</h3>
<p>This path requires securing Fealty Uplink breakthrough Round 1.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1:</strong> Hyper Metabolism (GG) - 3 command tokens
per status phase (economy)</p>
<p><strong>Round 2:</strong> AI Development Algorithm - Skip unit
upgrade prereqs, production cost reduction</p>
<p><strong>Round 3:</strong> War Sun (RRRY) - Massive capital ship,
BOMBARDMENT 3 (x3), removes Planetary Shield</p>
<p><strong>Round 4:</strong> X-89 Bacterial Weapon (GGG) - DOUBLE
BOMBARDMENT every round. Death Star-level orbital annihilation. How does
anyone stay alive on the ground? | OR Destroyer II (RR) - Cost 1, combat
8, ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE 6 (x3)</p>
<p><strong>Round 5:</strong> Flexible as Round 4</p>
<p>You become an unstoppable monster on the ground with Harrow, easy
access to mechs, and tons of bonus infantry from Fealty Uplink. However,
you might struggle in space combat. Consider prioritizing Destroyer II
first to shore up your anti-fighter capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A blue skip allows you to get Gravity Drive in
this path. Cruiser II (GYR) is a good 3rd unit upgrade option for bonus
mobility.</p>
<h3 id="d.-path-choices">D. Path Choices</h3>
<p><strong>Resource-heavy slice:</strong> War Sun path (New Age Path)
allows you to leverage high resources for expensive War Suns.</p>
<p><strong>Influence-heavy slice:</strong> Blue Path is slightly better.
More influence helps offset your 5/0 home system for command token
economy.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vi.-strategy-cards">VI. Strategy Cards</h2>
<h3 id="a.-round-1">A. Round 1</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1 Priority Ranking:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Trade</strong> - Trade goods &gt; resources. Three TG +
washing 2 commodities is solid value.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leadership</strong> - Excellent for breakthrough path.
Three command tokens enable strong Round 1 expansion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology</strong> - Solid. You’re very
tech-dependent.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Five-resource home system is
amazing. Spend 5 on tech, ready it, spend 5 on plastic. With blue skip,
grab Gravity Drive immediately.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Politics</strong> - Breakthrough access and bonus money
for good speaker position Round 2.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Warfare</strong> - You start with 2C4i. Don’t need to
over-expand Round 1. Can be better than Construction depending on
slice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Construction</strong> - You can steal structures with
Assimilate. Let your neighbors build, then take their stuff. Gives less
value than other options.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Imperial</strong> - Never pick Round 1. You’re not
holding Mecatol Rex yet.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you’re playing L1, you should probably not
be bottom of speaker order. You need access to good strategy cards.</p>
<h3 id="b.-round-2-priority">B. Round 2+ Priority</h3>
<p><strong>Love:</strong> - <strong>Technology</strong> - Keep investing
in tech. You need 5-7 technologies to be good. - <strong>Trade</strong>
- Trade goods solve your economy problems. Take it if available. -
<strong>Leadership</strong> - Command token economy. Solid every
round.</p>
<p><strong>Good:</strong> - <strong>Imperial</strong> - Very good for
scoring points and actually winning. - <strong>Politics</strong> -
Setting up flexibility for next round, but usually you have a hand full
of action cards anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Situational:</strong> - <strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Only for
scoring late. - <strong>Warfare</strong> - For specific aggressive play.
- <strong>Construction</strong> - If you got forward dock.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vii.-intermediate">VII. Intermediate</h2>
<h3 id="a.-unit-composition">A. Unit Composition</h3>
<p><strong>Blue Path Composition:</strong> <strong>Dreadnoughts +
Carrier + Fighters + Infantry</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dreadnoughts:</strong> Your core units. Build 4+ for
Commander unlock, then keep producing. Upgrade to Super Dreadnought II
for move 2. BOMBARDMENT with Harrow makes invasions trivial.</li>
<li><strong>Carrier:</strong> Capacity for infantry transport. Upgrade
to Carrier II for 6 capacity and move 2.</li>
<li><strong>Fighters:</strong> Screen for dreadnoughts. Absorb hits in
space combat.</li>
<li><strong>Infantry:</strong> Ground forces for invasion.</li>
<li><strong>Mechs:</strong> Deploy 1-2 mechs for BOMBARDMENT orbital
support. Don’t need many—they’re expensive (2 resources) and niche.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>New Age Path Composition:</strong> <strong>War Suns +
Destroyers + Infantry + Mechs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>War Suns:</strong> Your capital ships. Replace dreadnoughts
as primary fleet power. BOMBARDMENT 3 (x3) removes Planetary
Shield.</li>
<li><strong>Dreadnoughts:</strong> Build 4 for Commander unlock, then
transition to War Suns.</li>
<li><strong>Destroyer II:</strong> Anti-fighter coverage. You struggle
in space combat without this.</li>
<li><strong>Mechs:</strong> Deploy 2-3 mechs. More important in this
path with Fealty Uplink and ground focus.</li>
<li><strong>Infantry:</strong> Fealty Uplink generates tons of free
infantry. X89 Bacterial Weapon makes you unstoppable on the ground.</li>
<li><strong>Cruiser II (bonus):</strong> Sneaky mobility for fast
strikes. Move 3 with capacity 1.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="b.-game-plan">B. Game Plan</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1 is make or break.</strong> Get everything rolling and
fill out your slice for a strong Round 2. If you manage to establish
production and secure your territory Round 1, the sky is the limit.</p>
<p><strong>Unlock breakthrough first thing</strong> to leverage a safe
slice later in game with tons of bonus infantry. Each planet on average
will have 2 extra infantry from Fealty Uplink. 3 infantry isn’t a quick
drive-by compared to most people that will have 1.</p>
<p><strong>Round 2-3: Plan and execute.</strong> Target fracture,
Mecatol Rex, or a neighbor. Plan Round 2, execute latest Round 3. No
silly ground forces will be enough to stop you. If you get through the
air, you get through the ground.</p>
<p>Even though your focus won’t be on PDS, smashing through a silly
“defensive faction” in Round 3 who relies on Planetary Shield will make
it a nightmare later for them to grab it back. You won’t have any PDS at
home, so plenty of plastic left in the box to place in an opponent’s
slice.</p>
<p><strong>Round 4: Plan for victory.</strong> You need a realistic plan
for how to win in Round 5. Assume bonus points from Styx. Position your
fleet, secure objectives, and prepare for the final push.</p>
<p><strong>Round 5: Execute your win.</strong> You have to solve your
own win-slaying. Use The Helmsman to teleport your fleet for decisive
strikes. Take what you need and win the game.</p>
<p><strong>Fracture opportunities:</strong> Push fracture for relics and
legendary planets. Your Hero teleports your fleet to Styx later in the
game for decisive positioning.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="viii.-objectives">VIII. Objectives</h2>
<h3 id="a.-objective-summary">A. Objective Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Decent economy but hard to access trade
goods. Control objectives that require low mobility are a strong part of
your kit. Very many possible Stage II objectives for swingy turns late
game.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Structures can be hard and very neighbor
dependent.</p>

<h2 id="ix.-alliance-priority">IX. Alliance Priority</h2>
<p>Trading for other factions’ Alliance promissory notes (which give you
access to their Commanders) can significantly boost your strategy. Here
are the top alliances to prioritize:</p>
<p><strong>Top Tier:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Nomad (Navarch Feng)</strong> - Produce flagship without
spending resources. Saves 8 resources. Always good value.</li>
<li><strong>Crimson Rebellion (Ahk Siever)</strong> - At end of combat,
gain commodity/TG. Combat-focused faction, smooths out TG access
weakness.</li>
<li><strong>Muaat (Magmus)</strong> - After you spend strategy token,
gain 1 trade good. Smooths out TG access weakness.</li>
<li><strong>Deepwrought (Aello)</strong> - When others research tech,
gain commodity/TG if they take -1 discount. Smooths out TG access
weakness.</li>
<li><strong>Naaz-Rokha (Dart and Tai)</strong> - After you gain control
of planet from another player, explore that planet. Extra value from
conquests.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Good:</strong></p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><strong>Obsidian (Aroz Hollow)</strong> - Apply +1 combat in The
Fracture. Late game Styx plays with Hero teleport.</li>
<li><strong>Nekro Virus (Nekro Acidos)</strong> - After you gain tech,
draw 1 action card. Tech-heavy faction.</li>
<li><strong>Winnu (Rickar Rickani)</strong> - Apply +2 combat in MR,
home system, and legendary planet systems. Boosts fleet in key
battles.</li>
<li><strong>Empyrean (Xuange)</strong> - After another player moves
ships into system with your token, return token to reinforcements. Late
game slaying tool.</li>
</ol>

<p>This section highlights action cards that synergize particularly well
with your faction’s strengths or mitigate your weaknesses, relics that
offer exceptional value for your faction’s strategy and abilities, and
agendas to pursue that benefit your position, and agendas to watch out
for that could hurt you.</p>

<p>L1Z1X Mindnet is one of the most fun and flexible factions in
Twilight Imperium. Want to bomb the shit out of your friends? L1Z1X has
you covered. Build massive dreadnought fleets, unleash devastating
orbital bombardment, and invade planets with overwhelming force. Your
opponents build structures? You steal them. They fortify their planets?
You ignore Planetary Shield and bomb them anyway. Need to make a
surprise play across the galaxy? Teleport your entire fleet with The
Helmsman.</p>
<p>L1Z1X is an excellent faction for learning Twilight Imperium. You
have straightforward mechanics that teach core concepts: production,
combat, territory control, and military objectives. Your faction excels
at multiple strategies—whether you go for the classic dreadnought swarm
or the experimental War Sun path. You’re strong throughout the game,
from early territorial expansion to late game win-slaying.</p>
<p>Most importantly, L1Z1X delivers on the power fantasy. You’re not
subtle. You’re not diplomatic. You’re the galaxy’s most feared military
force, and everyone knows it. When you show up in someone’s home system
with a fleet of Super Dreadnoughts, they know exactly what’s about to
happen. Play L1Z1X, build the biggest fleet in the galaxy, and show your
table why nobody messes with the Mindnet.</p>
