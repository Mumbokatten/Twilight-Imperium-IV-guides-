# The L1Z1X Mindnet Comprehensive Strategy Guide

## I. Introduction

The L1Z1X Mindnet are Twilight Imperium's **premier dreadnought faction and ruthless assimilation machine**. You replace standard dreadnoughts with Super Dreadnought I (capacity 2, bombardment 5), start with both Neural Motivator and Plasma Scoring technologies, and possess Assimilate (steal enemy space docks and PDS when conquering planets) and Harrow (bombardment after each ground combat round). Your commander ignores planetary shields for bombardment, and your hero teleports your entire dreadnought fleet to a single system. This faction rewards aggressive conquest, overwhelming firepower, and leveraging bombardment to soften ground defenses. You are the galaxy's most feared war machine—relentless, efficient, and unstoppable once your dreadnought armada reaches critical mass.

## II. Playstyle

**Early Game (Rounds 1-2):**
Your opening is defined by your starting Super Dreadnought I and aggressive expansion. Use your bombardment advantage (5-rolled hits) to soften planets before invasions, reducing infantry losses. Assimilate is your economic engine: every conquered enemy planet with a space dock or PDS gives you those structures for free, accelerating your production infrastructure. Target neighbors with early space docks (Sol, Jol-Nar, Arborec) to steal their production facilities. Your 5-resource home system supports early builds, but your 0 influence creates severe political weakness. Focus on territorial control through military force, not diplomacy. Build more dreadnoughts immediately—you need 4 to unlock your commander.

**Mid Game (Rounds 3-4):**
This is when L1Z1X becomes terrifying. Unlock your commander (4 dreadnoughts on board) to ignore planetary shields with bombardment, making PDS networks and planetary shield action cards worthless. Build Super Dreadnought II (upgrade requires 2 blue, 1 yellow) for movement 2, combat 4, bombardment 4, and immunity to Direct Hit. Mass-produce dreadnoughts using your assimilated space docks; each conquest adds more production capacity. Harrow ability lets you bombardment AFTER EACH ROUND of ground combat, wearing down defenders over multiple rounds. Research Inheritance Systems (2 yellow) to ignore tech prerequisites, opening any technology path. Control Mecatol Rex through overwhelming force—your bombardment softens it before invasion.

**Late Game (Rounds 5-6+):**
Your hero (The Helmsman) becomes a game-ending ability: move your flagship and ALL dreadnoughts from anywhere on the board to a single system. This creates unstoppable force concentration—6-8 dreadnoughts appearing instantly to conquer critical objectives, Mecatol Rex, or deny opponents' scoring. Your Fealty Uplink breakthrough (red/green) grants free infantry equal to planet influence when conquering, solving your ground force sustainability. By this stage, you should control 3-4 assimilated space docks, field 6-10 dreadnoughts, and dominate through superior firepower. Victory comes from **territorial conquest**—you score objectives requiring planet control, combat victories, and spending resources easily. Opponents cannot match your military efficiency.

## III. The Basics

### A. Home System & Commodities

**[0.0.0] (Home System):** 5 resources, 0 influence
- A completely barren planet with ZERO influence
- 5 resources is solid for early production
- No influence creates severe political weakness
- Cannot contribute to influence-based objectives early
- One of the most resource-focused home systems in the game

**Commodities:** 2
- Very low economic capacity
- You're a war faction, not a trade faction
- Trade when possible but don't rely on commodity economy
- Focus on conquest for economic growth (Assimilate stolen structures)

**Optimal Resource/Influence from Home Worlds:**
- [0.0.0] contributes 5 optimally for resources, 0 for influence
- Total: 5 optimal resources / 0 optimal influence from home
- You DESPERATELY need influence-rich planets early
- Politics is your weakest phase; plan accordingly

### B. Starting Fleet

**1 Dreadnought (Super Dreadnought I):**
- Your unique dreadnought replacement
- Cost 4, Combat 5, Move 1, Capacity 2, Bombardment 5, Sustain Damage
- CAPACITY 2 is critical (can transport infantry for invasions)
- Bombardment 5 softens planets before ground combat
- Forms the core of your early fleet

**1 Carrier:**
- Standard capacity 6 carrier
- Transports your 5 starting infantry
- Less important than for other factions (dreadnoughts have capacity)
- Still needed for large-scale invasions early

**3 Fighters:**
- Standard space combat fodder
- Screening units for your dreadnoughts
- Less emphasis than other factions; you favor capital ships

**5 Infantry:**
- Standard ground force complement
- Adequate for early planet captures
- Bombardment reduces losses, extending sustainability

**1 Space Dock:**
- Already built at [0.0.0]
- Produce more dreadnoughts immediately
- Assimilate will steal more space docks from enemies

**1 PDS:**
- Unusual starting structure
- Provides early defensive coverage
- Synergizes with Plasma Scoring (PDS hits on 7s)

### C. Starting Tech

**Neural Motivator (Yellow):**
- When you gain command tokens during the status phase, gain 1 additional command token
- 3 tokens per status phase instead of 2
- Critical for command-token-hungry war factions
- Helps fund tactical actions for aggressive expansion

**Plasma Scoring (Yellow):**
- Your PDS units roll one additional die during space cannon offense or defense
- Synergizes with your starting PDS
- Less critical than Neural Motivator but still valuable
- Supports defensive PDS networks if you build more

**Technology Specialties to Prioritize:**
- **Industrial (Blue):** For Super Dreadnought II path
- **Cybernetic (Yellow):** For Inheritance Systems (ignore prerequisites)
- **Hazardous (Red):** For Fealty Uplink breakthrough and combat technologies

### D. Faction Abilities

**Assimilate:**
*When you gain control of a planet, replace each PDS and space dock that is on that planet with a matching unit from your reinforcements.*

- **STEAL** enemy space docks and PDS when conquering planets
- Structures transfer to you from reinforcements (must have available)
- Massive economic advantage: enemy investment becomes your infrastructure
- Prioritize conquering planets with space docks (high-value targets)
- Sol, Jol-Nar, Arborec, and other factions that build early space docks = premium targets
- PDS networks also transfer, giving you defensive coverage
- Does NOT work if you don't have structures in reinforcements (plan accordingly)
- You still "destroy" original structures; Assimilate replaces them with yours

**Harrow:**
*After each round of ground combat, your ships in the active system may use their BOMBARDMENT abilities against your opponent's ground forces on the planet.*

- Bombardment happens AFTER EACH ROUND of ground combat
- Normal bombardment: before ground combat starts
- Harrow bombardment: after Round 1, after Round 2, etc., until combat ends
- Wears down defenders over multiple rounds
- Example: Round 1 ground combat → Harrow bombardment → Round 2 ground combat → Harrow bombardment
- Works with ALL bombardment-capable ships (dreadnoughts, war suns, mechs)
- Combined with commander (ignores planetary shields), this becomes devastating
- Encourages sustained ground combats rather than quick alpha strikes
- Your mech (Annihilator) has bombardment 8 and can bombard from ground

### E. Leaders

**Agent: I48S**
*After a player activates a system: You may exhaust this card to allow that player to replace 1 of their infantry in the active system with 1 mech from their reinforcements.*

- Exhausts after ANY player activates a system
- Replaces 1 infantry with 1 mech for that player
- Trading tool: offer mech upgrades to other players for support
- Can use on yourself for tactical mech deployment
- Value varies by faction: high-value for Barony, Sardakk, Naalu (strong mechs)
- Low transaction value compared to other agents
- Primarily used for diplomatic deals

**Commander: 2RAM**
*Unlock: Have 4 dreadnoughts on the game board.*
*Units that have Planetary Shield do not prevent you from using BOMBARDMENT.*

- Unlock: 4 dreadnoughts on board (easy for L1Z1X)
- **IGNORES PLANETARY SHIELDS** for bombardment
- Planetary Shield action cards become worthless against you
- PDS structures grant planetary shields; commander bypasses them
- Combined with Harrow, you bombardment after EVERY ground combat round regardless of shields
- Unlock this as early as possible (Round 2-3 with aggressive dreadnought production)
- Devastating against defensive factions (Xxcha, defensive PDS networks)

**Hero: The Helmsman**
*Unlock: Have 3 scored objectives.*
*Dark Space Navigation:*
*ACTION: Choose 1 system that does not contain other players' ships; you may move your flagship and any number of your dreadnoughts from other systems into the chosen system. Then, purge this card.*

- One-time-use ability
- Move flagship + ALL dreadnoughts from ANYWHERE to one target system
- Target system cannot contain other players' ships (must be empty or only your ships)
- Instant force concentration: 6-10 dreadnoughts appearing in one location
- Applications:
  - Conquer Mecatol Rex with overwhelming force
  - Threaten critical objective planets
  - Defend against coordinated attacks
  - Score territorial objectives instantly
- Use timing: Round 5-6 when game-deciding objectives appear
- Leaves non-dreadnought ships behind (fighters, carriers stay)
- Combined with Super Dreadnought II (move 2), you have incredible reach

### F. Promissory Note

**Cybernetic Enhancements Ω:**
*When you gain command tokens during the status phase: Gain 1 additional command token. Then, return this card to the L1Z1X player.*

- Grants +1 command token during status phase to holder
- Effectively gives them Neural Motivator benefit for one round
- Used during status phase, then returns to you
- Moderate transaction value: worth 1-3 trade goods or commodities
- Command-token-starved factions value this (Nekro, Sardakk, war-focused players)
- Can be traded repeatedly after it returns
- Useful diplomatic tool but not game-breaking

### G. Alliance

**Alliance Ability:**
*While you are neighbors with the L1Z1X player, you gain the following alliance ability:*
*Harrow - After each round of ground combat, your ships in the active system may use their BOMBARDMENT abilities against your opponent's ground forces on the planet.*

- Grants Harrow ability to an ally
- Neighbor must control or have units in systems adjacent to your units/controlled systems
- Powerful for bombardment-capable factions (War Suns, Dreadnoughts)
- Enables sustained ground combat bombardment for allies
- Moderate value: helpful but not faction-defining like Creuss Quantum Entanglement
- Best for aggressive factions that invade frequently (Sardakk, Sol, Barony)

### H. Mech

**Annihilator:**
*Cost: 2*
*Combat: 6*
*Sustain Damage*
*BOMBARDMENT 8*
*While not participating in ground combat, this unit can use its BOMBARDMENT ability on planets in its system as if it were a ship.*

- Standard mech combat 6 with Sustain Damage
- **BOMBARDMENT 8** (incredible for a ground force)
- Can bombardment from ground IF not participating in ground combat
- Scenario: Land mech on Planet A, invade Planet B in same system → mech can bombardment Planet B
- Does NOT bombardment if the mech is fighting in the ground combat
- Synergizes with Harrow: bombardment 8 after each ground combat round
- Deploy multiple mechs in multi-planet systems for sustained bombardment
- Expensive at cost 2 but extremely powerful utility

### I. Flagship

**[0.0.1]:**
*Cost: 8*
*Combat: 5 (x2)*
*Move: 1*
*Capacity: 5*
*Sustain Damage*
*During a space combat, hits produced by this ship and by your dreadnoughts in this system must be assigned to non-fighter ships if able.*

- 2 dice at combat 5 (solid firepower)
- Capacity 5 (large transport capability)
- **Forces non-fighter ship hits**: Flagship and dreadnought hits bypass fighters
- Opponents cannot use fighters as fodder against your flagship/dreadnoughts
- Devastating against fighter-heavy fleets
- Forces opponents to lose capital ships first
- Synergizes with mass dreadnought fleets
- Combined with Super Dreadnought II (combat 4), you shred enemy fleets efficiently

### J. Breakthrough

**Fealty Uplink (Red <> Green):**
*When you gain control of a planet, place infantry from your reinforcements equal to that planet's influence value on that planet.*

- Gain FREE infantry equal to planet's influence when conquering
- Example: Conquer 3-influence planet → gain 3 free infantry on that planet
- Solves ground force sustainability problem
- High-influence planets become double-value: influence + free troops
- Synergizes with conquest-heavy playstyle
- Infantry must come from reinforcements (manage your reinforcements)
- Late-game breakthrough requiring red + green prerequisites
- Transforms you into a self-sustaining conquest machine

### K. Slice Considerations

**Critical Priorities:**

1. **High Resources:**
   - Your home gives 5 resources; you need more for dreadnought spam
   - Target 12-15 total resources from slice
   - Industrial planets (blue tech specialty) support Super Dreadnought II path
   - Hazardous planets (red tech specialty) support Fealty Uplink breakthrough

2. **INFLUENCE IS CRITICAL:**
   - You start with ZERO influence
   - Need influence-rich planets desperately
   - Target 8-10 influence from slice minimum
   - Cultural planets help with influence and objectives
   - Without influence, you lose every political phase

3. **Neighbor Selection:**
   - Prioritize neighbors with early space docks: Sol, Jol-Nar, Arborec
   - Assimilate is most valuable against production-heavy factions
   - Avoid isolated positions; you need conquest targets

4. **Mecatol Access:**
   - You conquer Mecatol through force, not speed
   - Moderate Mecatol proximity acceptable
   - Your hero teleports dreadnoughts, so distant Mecatol less punishing

**Ideal Slice Characteristics:**
- 12-15 resources, 8-10 influence (after [0.0.0])
- 2-3 industrial/hazardous technology specialties
- Neighbors with space docks to assimilate
- Multi-planet systems for mech bombardment utility

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

**1. Zero Starting Influence:**
Your [0.0.0] home system gives absolutely no influence, making you the weakest faction in early politics. You cannot spend influence for objectives, vote meaningfully in agendas, or compete with influence-rich factions (Xxcha, Winnu, Hacan) until you expand. Agenda phases Rounds 1-3 will punish you severely unless you aggressively conquer influence planets.

**2. Low Commodities (2):**
With only 2 commodities, your trade economy is terrible. You cannot leverage Trade strategy card effectively, and other factions won't prioritize trading with you. Economic growth relies on Assimilate (stealing structures), not trade. You'll struggle to fund expensive technologies or large fleets without conquest.

**3. Slow Early Movement:**
Super Dreadnought I has movement 1, and you don't start with Gravity Drive. Early expansion is slower than mobile factions (Naalu, Ghosts, Saar). You must research Super Dreadnought II (requires 2 blue, 1 yellow) to gain movement 2. Until then, you're vulnerable to faster opponents outpacing you territorially.

**4. Commander Dependency:**
Your commander (ignoring planetary shields) requires 4 dreadnoughts on board. If you cannot afford to build 4 dreadnoughts early (economic pressure, conflict, limited production), your commander unlock delays, and you lose critical bombardment utility. Against defensive factions, this delay is punishing.

**5. Ground Force Sustainability:**
You start with only 5 infantry. Invasions cost ground forces, and without Fealty Uplink breakthrough (late-game), you struggle to sustain multi-planet conquests. Early wars can drain your infantry reserves, forcing expensive infantry production or reliance on risky bombardment-only invasions.

**6. Reinforcement Limitations:**
Assimilate requires structures in your reinforcements. If all your space docks or PDS are on the board, you cannot assimilate enemy structures—they're simply destroyed. You must manage reinforcements carefully, sometimes sacrificing structures to free reinforcements for assimilation.

**7. Political Weakness:**
Zero influence, 2 commodities, and war-focused abilities make you diplomatically weak. Other players will gang up on the warmonger. You have few trading tools (weak promissory note, weak agent), making alliances harder to secure. You'll fight 2v1 or 3v1 scenarios frequently.

**8. Technology Prerequisites:**
Super Dreadnought II requires 2 blue + 1 yellow (3 total technologies). Inheritance Systems (prerequisite-ignoring tech) requires 2 yellow. Your starting technologies (Neural Motivator, Plasma Scoring) are both yellow (0-cost), meaning they DON'T count as prerequisites for most technologies. You must research additional prerequisite technologies, delaying critical upgrades.

## V. Technology

### A. Starting Technologies

**Neural Motivator (Yellow - 0 Cost):**
- +1 command token during status phase
- Critical for war factions
- Does NOT count as a prerequisite for technologies requiring "yellow"
- Faction-defining economic technology

**Plasma Scoring (Yellow - 0 Cost):**
- PDS units roll +1 die during space cannon
- Synergizes with starting PDS
- Does NOT count as a prerequisite for technologies requiring "yellow"
- Less impactful than Neural Motivator

**Key Note on 0-Cost Technologies:**
- Neural Motivator and Plasma Scoring do NOT count as prerequisites
- To research technologies requiring "1 yellow," you must research Sarween Tools, Graviton Laser System, or another yellow tech
- This delays your tech path compared to factions with normal starting technologies

### B. Technology Paths

**Primary Path (Dreadnought Focus):**

Round 1-2: **Antimass Deflectors (Blue) OR Sarween Tools (Yellow)**
- Antimass Deflectors: +1 move capacity, opens blue path toward Super Dreadnought II
- Sarween Tools: +1 fighter/infantry per production, economic efficiency

Round 2-3: **Gravity Drive (Blue) + 1 Yellow Tech**
- Gravity Drive: +1 movement for all ships (dreadnoughts move 2)
- Yellow tech: Sarween Tools OR Neural Motivator (counts as prerequisite now)
- This unlocks Super Dreadnought II prerequisites (2 blue, 1 yellow)

Round 3-4: **Super Dreadnought II (2 Blue, 1 Yellow)**
- Upgrade: Cost 4, Combat 4, Move 2, Capacity 2, Bombardment 4, Sustain Damage
- Immune to Direct Hit action cards
- Movement 2 enables rapid conquest
- Essential upgrade

Round 4+: **Inheritance Systems (2 Yellow) OR Duranium Armor**
- Inheritance Systems: Exhaust + spend 2 resources to ignore all prerequisites
- Opens ANY technology path without prerequisites
- Game-changing flexibility
- Alternative: Duranium Armor (repair sustain damage during status phase)

**Alternative Path (Fealty Uplink Breakthrough):**

Round 4-5: Research red and green prerequisites for Fealty Uplink (Red <> Green)
- Red: Magen Defense Grid, Assault Cannon
- Green: Hyper Metabolism, X-89 Bacterial Weapon
- Fealty Uplink: Free infantry equal to influence when conquering planets
- Solves ground force sustainability

**Technology Sequencing Example (Optimal Path):**

1. **Round 1:** Sarween Tools (yellow - prerequisite)
2. **Round 2:** Antimass Deflectors (blue - prerequisite) + movement boost
3. **Round 3:** Gravity Drive (blue - 2nd prerequisite) + Carrier II movement
4. **Round 3-4:** Super Dreadnought II (2 blue, 1 yellow) - Dreadnought upgrade
5. **Round 4-5:** Inheritance Systems (2 yellow) - Ignore prerequisites
6. **Round 5-6:** Use Inheritance Systems to research Duranium Armor, Fleet Logistics, or Fealty Uplink without prerequisites

### C. Key Technologies

**Super Dreadnought II (2 Blue, 1 Yellow Prerequisites):**
*L1Z1X Dreadnought: Cost 4, Combat 4, Move 2, Capacity 2, BOMBARDMENT 4, Sustain Damage. This unit cannot be destroyed by "Direct Hit" action cards.*

- Your faction's most critical technology
- Movement 2 (doubles dreadnought mobility)
- Combat 4 (only needs 4+ to hit instead of 5+)
- Bombardment 4 (still strong)
- **Immune to Direct Hit** (opponents cannot destroy your sustain damage)
- Cost remains 4 (same as Super Dreadnought I)
- Research this by Round 3-4 minimum

**Inheritance Systems (2 Yellow Prerequisites):**
*You may exhaust this card and spend 2 resources when you research a technology; ignore all of that technology's prerequisites.*

- Exhaust + 2 resources = ignore ALL prerequisites for one technology
- Opens any technology path without research investment
- Example: Research War Sun (4 yellow prereqs) by exhausting Inheritance Systems + 2 resources
- Extremely flexible
- Late-game technology (requires 2 yellow, and you start with 0-cost yellows)
- Enables tech-skipping strategies

**Duranium Armor (2 Yellow Prerequisites):**
*During the status phase, repair all of your damaged units that are on the game board.*

- Repair ALL damaged units during status phase
- Sustain damage units (dreadnoughts, flagship, mechs) auto-repair
- Incredible sustainability for dreadnought fleets
- Synergizes with mass sustain damage units
- Reduces need for space docks near front lines

**Fleet Logistics (Blue):**
*During each of your turns in the action phase, you may perform 2 actions instead of 1.*

- 2 tactical actions per round instead of 1
- Essential for aggressive expansion
- Enables multi-front wars
- Consider researching via Inheritance Systems if prerequisites expensive

**Assault Cannon (Red):**
*At the start of a space combat in a system that contains 3 or more of your non-fighter ships, your opponent must destroy 1 of their non-fighter ships.*

- Pre-combat kill if you have 3+ non-fighter ships
- Dreadnought-heavy fleets easily trigger this
- Devastating against capital ship fleets
- Opens red path toward Fealty Uplink

## VI. Strategy Cards

### A. Round 1 Ratings

**Leadership (1):** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ - High Value
You need command tokens for aggressive tactical actions. Neural Motivator helps, but Leadership accelerates expansion. Secondary is excellent.

**Diplomacy (2):** ⭐⭐ - Low Value
Planet readying is weak Round 1. You're not defending Mecatol yet. Skip unless desperate for ready planets.

**Politics (3):** ⭐⭐ - Low Value
You have zero influence. Speaker token doesn't help you win votes. Action card draw is nice but not worth top pick.

**Construction (4):** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Maximum Value
You need space docks to spam dreadnoughts. Assimilate works better if you have reinforcements available. Build PDS for defensive coverage. Top-tier Round 1.

**Trade (5):** ⭐⭐ - Low Value
Only 2 commodities. Trade economy is weak. Secondary refreshes commodities, but you won't get much value. Skip.

**Warfare (6):** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ - High Value
Remove command tokens from opponent systems to enable conquests. Redistribute your own fleet. Solid for aggressive play.

**Technology (7):** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ - Maximum Value
You NEED Super Dreadnought II. Early tech advantage accelerates your power spike. Secondary also valuable. Top-tier Round 1.

**Imperial (8):** ⭐⭐⭐ - Moderate Value
Scoring Round 1 is nice if you have scoreable objectives. Otherwise, skip for more aggressive picks.

### B. General Strategy Card Priority

**Rounds 2-3:**
- **Technology (7):** Push toward Super Dreadnought II, Inheritance Systems
- **Construction (4):** Build space docks for dreadnought production
- **Warfare (6):** Remove tokens, redistribute fleets for conquest
- **Leadership (1):** Command token replenishment for sustained aggression

**Rounds 4-5:**
- **Warfare (6):** Multi-front wars, token removal for critical conquests
- **Imperial (8):** Scoring from Mecatol control or Imperial Rider
- **Technology (7):** Inheritance Systems, Duranium Armor, unit upgrades
- **Construction (4):** PDS networks, forward space docks

**Round 6+:**
- **Imperial (8):** Score to close out the game
- **Warfare (6):** Tactical flexibility, Mecatol control
- **Leadership (1):** Command token pool management

## VII. Intermediate

### A. Unit Composition

**Early Game Fleet (Rounds 1-2):**
- 3-4 Dreadnoughts (Super Dreadnought I → upgrade to II ASAP)
- 1-2 Carriers (transport infantry for invasions)
- 4-6 Fighters (screening, space combat fodder)
- 8-12 Infantry (ground invasions)
- 2 Space Docks ([0.0.0] + 1 assimilated OR built)
- 1-2 PDS (defensive coverage)

**Mid Game Fleet (Rounds 3-4):**
- 6-8 Dreadnoughts (Super Dreadnought II ideally)
- 2-3 Carriers (capacity for sustained invasions)
- 6-8 Fighters (screening)
- 12-16 Infantry (conquest sustainability)
- 3-4 Space Docks (assimilated from conquests)
- 2-4 PDS (defensive networks)
- 1 Flagship (force hit assignment, capacity 5)

**Late Game Fleet (Rounds 5-6+):**
- 10-12 Dreadnoughts (Super Dreadnought II)
- 3-4 Carriers
- 8-10 Fighters
- 16-20 Infantry (supplemented by Fealty Uplink if researched)
- 4-5 Space Docks (assimilated empire-wide)
- 4-6 PDS (defensive coverage across territory)
- 1 Flagship
- 1-2 War Suns (if resources permit via Inheritance Systems)
- 2-4 Mechs (bombardment utility in multi-planet systems)

**Key Principles:**
- **Dreadnoughts are your core**: Build 4 ASAP for commander unlock, scale to 8-12 late-game
- Carriers for transport, not combat (dreadnoughts have capacity 2)
- Infantry sustainability via Fealty Uplink OR frequent production
- Mechs for bombardment in multi-planet systems
- Space docks from Assimilate, not Construction (ideal scenario)

### B. Point Planning

**"Christmas Land" Scoring Table:**

| Round | Public Objective 1 | Public Objective 2 | Secret Objective | Mecatol/Other | Total Points | Running Total |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| 1 | Spend 3 Resources (1) | - | - | - | 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 6 Technologies (1) | Control 6 Planets (1) | Destroy 4 Units (1) | - | 3 | 4 |
| 3 | Control 3 Hazardous (1) | 3 Ships in Non-Home (1) | - | Mecatol (1) | 3 | 7 |
| 4 | 5+ Technologies (2) | Spend 8 Resources (2) | Win vs 3+ Ships (1) | - | 5 | 12 |
| 5 | - | - | - | Imperial Point (1) | 1 | 13 |
| 6 | Control 11 Planets (2) | Win vs 2 Ships (2 systems) (2) | - | Support Throne (1) | 5 | 18 |

This scenario shows L1Z1X leveraging combat-based objectives, resource-spend objectives (high resources from conquests), and territorial control (Assimilate expansion) to reach 18+ points.

**Realistic Adjustments:**
- Combat secrets (Destroy 4 Units, Win vs Ships) fit L1Z1X naturally
- May not hold Mecatol Round 3 if contested by multiple players
- Resource-spend objectives are easy with conquest economy
- Stage II territorial objectives (11 planets, 5 hazardous/industrial) are achievable

**Legend:** 🟢 Likely | 🟡 Possible | 🔴 Difficult

L1Z1X dominate combat and territorial objectives through dreadnought spam and bombardment. Influence objectives are challenging.

## IX. Alliance Priority

Your alliance ability (granting Harrow bombardment after each ground combat round) is **moderately powerful** and best traded to aggressive factions.

**High-Value Alliance Partners:**

1. **Bombardment-Capable Factions:**
   - **Sol Federation:** Lots of dreadnoughts; Harrow amplifies bombardment sustainability
   - **Barony of Letnev:** Dreadnought-heavy; benefits from repeated bombardment rounds
   - **Sardakk N'orr:** Aggressive ground combat faction; Harrow wears down defenders
   - **Titans of Ul:** War Suns and dreadnoughts benefit from sustained bombardment

2. **Invasion-Focused Factions:**
   - **Xxcha Kingdom:** Defensive but can invade; Harrow helps overcome fortified positions
   - **Mentak Coalition:** Piracy and invasion; benefits from bombardment advantage
   - **Yin Brotherhood:** Kamikaze + bombardment after ground combat rounds

3. **Ground-Combat-Heavy Factions:**
   - **Arborec:** Sustained ground presence; Harrow wears down enemies
   - **Naalu Collective:** Mech-focused; Harrow synergizes with ground combat

**Low-Value Alliance Partners:**

- **Hacan:** Trade faction; doesn't invade frequently
- **Jol-Nar:** Fragile; avoids combat
- **Winnu:** Weak military; less bombardment utility

**What to Demand in Exchange:**

- **Economic Support:** Trade goods, commodities (you have low commodity economy)
- **Political Support:** Votes on agendas (you have zero influence)
- **Territory Agreements:** Non-aggression pacts, shared conquest targets
- **Military Support:** Joint wars against defensive factions

**Timing Considerations:**

- Early alliance (Rounds 1-2): Secures non-aggression, helps political weakness
- Mid alliance (Rounds 3-4): Enables joint Mecatol conquest or multi-front wars
- Late alliance (Rounds 5-6): Avoid empowering competitors; only if necessary for victory

## X. End Notes

The L1Z1X Mindnet are Twilight Imperium's **most efficient war machine**, converting conquest into economic growth through Assimilate and leveraging overwhelming dreadnought firepower to dominate the galaxy. Your success depends on **aggressive expansion, dreadnought mass production, and leveraging bombardment to minimize losses**.

**Key Principles for Success:**

1. **Build 4 Dreadnoughts ASAP:** Commander unlock (ignoring planetary shields) is critical. Reach this by Round 2-3.

2. **Prioritize Super Dreadnought II:** Movement 2, combat 4, immunity to Direct Hit transforms your fleet. Research this by Round 3-4 minimum.

3. **Target Space Docks with Assimilate:** Sol, Jol-Nar, Arborec build early space docks. Conquer them to steal their production infrastructure.

4. **Manage Reinforcements:** Keep space docks/PDS in reinforcements to assimilate. Don't deploy all structures early.

5. **Leverage Harrow:** Bombardment after EACH ground combat round wears down defenders. Don't rush invasions; let bombardment soften planets over multiple rounds.

6. **Conquer Influence Planets Early:** You start with zero influence. Prioritize high-influence planets (3-5 influence) to fix political weakness.

7. **Use Inheritance Systems Strategically:** Ignore prerequisites to research War Suns, Fleet Logistics, or Fealty Uplink without expensive tech paths.

8. **Time Hero Perfectly:** Teleport all dreadnoughts to conquer critical objectives, Mecatol, or deny opponents scoring. Round 5-6 optimal timing.

9. **Spam Dreadnoughts:** Your faction scales with dreadnought count. Field 8-12 dreadnoughts late-game for unstoppable fleets.

10. **Avoid Political Fights:** You have zero influence and 2 commodities. Focus on military dominance, not diplomacy or trade.

L1Z1X rewards **ruthless aggression and efficient conquest**. You're not here to make friends or trade—your goal is total assimilation. Master bombardment timing, manage reinforcements for Assimilate, and unleash your dreadnought armada to crush all opposition. When played optimally, L1Z1X is unstoppable once the dreadnought ball reaches critical mass.

**The Mindnet expands. Resistance is obsolete.**
