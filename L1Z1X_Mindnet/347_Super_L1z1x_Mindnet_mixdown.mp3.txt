Nobody cares about that.Some day though.Some day though.What if we like...I mean, this is a crazy thing to say.Yeah, yeah.But just, like, just ate the RPG book and just started.You know what I mean?There's a lot of stuff in there.There is a lot of stuff in there.Yeah, I mean, we haven't been back to the RPG in quite a while and I would love to.Yeah, last time we did it, I remember a lot of complaining out of you.I remember a lot of...I'm just saying we can read the book.I'm just saying let's read the book and see where we go.See where we go.I don't know.I don't know.Alright.Alright, hey, guess what?You know what they start with?Their starting plastic is one dread not a whole one of them, a carrier, three fighters,five infantry for some reason.I think that's wild.A space lock and a PDS.They start with like a lot of plastic.Yeah.Yeah, it's a good start.My only complaint obviously is no trade ship.But beyond that, excellent start.And their dreadnoughts of course are not normal dreadnoughts, but we'll get to that ina second.What are their starting tech, Matthew?They have a green and a blue tech, which will be proven.A weird, incorrect.I said blue and I'm looking at the color red and I said, literally, I know, color codethem.And I'm here to talk trash on it because they don't start with the blue tech and I saidblue out loud.They have a green and a red and they have neural motivator for action cards and plasmascoring for boom bar.That's fine.That's good plasma scoring.It's a red tech, whatever.Yeah, that's what they have.Yeah, that's what they have.Their home system is called 0.0.0 aka null, which is a five resource, zero, influence,planet.Matt, can you read me that flavor tech?The solution of energy rich planet was the desperate destination of the secret lasaxdiaspora.Now it is a technological nightmare.It's weird to me that they had a destination in mind.That part is a bit of a tease, isn't it?There's a lot of information missing in that single word.Yes, I agree.It is a destination.And then again, still.No explanation for why is it a technological nightmare?Why did they do that?What's happening here?All we're saying is they put computers on their arms and stuff.They just did the corpo thing.They're just cyberpunk.Okay, leave them alone.Quit being so freaked out by them.They just have like visors on, bro.Yeah, but I'm going in a different direction.Why would they, what would be the use of all the cyber stuff?There just needs to be a reason, right?I don't know.I don't get it.I'm about that 5-0 planet lightly because 5 is an awkward amount to spend.But I feel like that's gone away to people.It's completely chill that it's 5 bucks.Or is it?Of course, there's so many advantages to it being 5.Who can bother complaining about an extra dollar?Who cares, definitely.It over yourself.Just two commodities.So whatever, who cares?Let's do their abilities, though.And this is where things, man, just to go back to it, when the very first time we everdid a tier list.And we read these abilities that I'm about to read.We freaked out.We thought, coming from our TI3 bearings and we had never played TI4, we read these two abilitiesand their faction specific upgrade.And we thought the world was ending just to be clear.They were in our top rank.They were ST in our very first tier list.I think they were better in base game.That's true.Simulate when you gain control of a planet, replace each PDS and space stock that is on thatplanet with a matching unit from your reinforcements.Ooh, Bazinga.Still like here in that one.Notably, that gain control of a planet and the replacement of that space stock is beforethe production step of a tactical action, which means you can, in fact, take someone spacestock, immediately build reinforcements out of it and have a stronger defending forcethan you attack with.Yep, it is sick.You know how people say like, "Oh, like, like, what is that yellow tech that everybody alwayswants?"Integrated economy.Oh, it's so good.It's so good.And it's like, literally L1 is starting with that but better if the opportunity presents itself.More situational but better.Their second ability is hero.At the end of each round of ground combat, your ships in the active system may use theirbombardment abilities against your opponent's ground forces on the planet.Oh, yeah.Very, I mean, still very good.This is like, it's funny.There was an argument about this ability like a year ago where somebody was like, "L1sucks because their abilities only kick in or they don't use their abilities all thetime."And I will say that philosophically, that is a problem with the entire kit, basically.But if you need hero, it is incredible.It is a hammer that comes down and we'll just make it the amount of security that you canfeel as an L1 player.I mean, like, I'm going to invade over here and be like, "Yeah, we're going to win that."Yeah, absolutely.And guess what?What they're bombarding with is super dreadnoughts.They're a faction specific unit, which is a four-cost, dreadnought, four-cost, five-combatone move, two capacity, but one on a five sustained damage, all the normal things.But that two capacity, super dread is what you start with.Yeah.And that's good because that means that our start of one dread, one carrier, ill, totallyaccomplishes 2C4i.Yeah, absolutely.And, yeah.So we dig that.The start is fine.And I mean, I would even say the start is almost great if not for that minor complaint.And actually, it's not so minor.It's actually indicative of larger overall problem with the L1, but I don't want to get toofar ahead of ourselves.Their flagship is the 0.0.1 as opposed to the null.And it is eight costs, two on a five, so the good kind.Capacity five, for some reason, like, suddenly this one flagship needs to have a little bitboost to capacity-compatible.Like some rules.It's like one of the best ones.And during a space combat, it's produced by this ship and by your dreadnoughts in thissystem, must be assigned to non-fighter ships if able.Yeah, really dig the flagship.It's going to come up again in other abilities.It is like the L1, I think, more so than most factions are incentivized to fold the flagshipinto their strategy.Do they have to do it every time?No.But is it useful when they do it?Yes.Yeah.But yes, we are sort of a fist flying through the E1.The air, looking for a face to punt, and this is the biggest knuckle on that fist.Everybody knows you punch with one knuckle forward.That's just the way to do it.You have one knuckle slightly protruding.Your knuckles kind of determine how much damage you're going to do.Those are the dice you're sort of rolling on your strength check.Our mechs are the annihilators, while not participating in ground combat.This unit can use its bombardment ability on planets in its system as if it were a shipthat's incredibly confusing.It has bombardment on and on it.It's all the other normal stats of a mech, but please explain what that text means.So basically what it means is that the bombardment step, the first bombardment step, you prettymuch can always use the annihilators.Once they get committed to a planet, you cannot use their bombardment abilities anymore.You get that first one for free, and also if you leave them in the space, you're stillgoing to get it, right?If you commit it to a planet, then that's it.You're done.It's not great bombardment.It's just bombardment, A.Yeah, that's the important.It's almost worded as if what a person could try to say is, I'm going to leave my mechsin the sky so that they can do hair row and maybe win this combat.But at the end of the day, the mechs on the ground, hitting on a six and soaking damagewith the sustain is in fact just better.Yeah, I think the only world where you would do that, which I forget actually on commitment,you don't have to commit everything.Actually, I'm not even sure that the material is going to commit everything.You can decide what you commit to each planet and you can just leave some stuff in thesky and all that.Okay, so I guess you can.The only world I can think of that it's useful, I guess, would be make an example, right?But does hair row even allow you to score, make an example if it's not on the first round?So the hang up nowadays is that we have make an example of their world, Omega, the new onethat was re-worded to sort of like clarify some things.And it's destroy the last of the player's ground forces on a planet during the bombardmentstep, which is the phase of a tactical action.But the hairobombardment is not during the bombardment step.You can't even use hair as a sneaky way to get, make an example.Now, to say this, you are good at making an example already.You're actually going to get that.Yeah, you're going to be able to get it somewhere.You've got a lot of reasons.You just can't get it this one really flashy, sneaky, goofy way that I'm sure somebodywould have wanted to do how it worked that way.But it don't sorry.Now though, this is actually because of the Codex3 change.It used to be that you could hair out.Right.Basically the wording specifically changed to make it the bombardment step.It didn't use to save an bombardment step.That caused other complications.That had to get fixed.And the repercussion for that was that L1 got nerfed a little bit, which is hilarious,actually, in the long run.So anyways, okay, very complicated thing all set aside.We're done.We finished the Mac.The promise or you know is cybernetic enhancements, which also got an Omega that we're going toread when you gain command tokens during the status phase, gain one additional command token,then return this card to the L1 Z1X player.My favorite most boring component.It is completely boring.This price is almost fixed like it is just it is worth exactly what it is worth.L1 shells it once around.That's it.Yep.Done.It's like mill support, but you can't sell it more than one.Right.Much worse.It's hugely worse.Right.But it is very sellable.I mean like it sold pretty much automatically.Yep.So it is kind of the perfect if your rule, if Danes rule on the chalkboard was L1 Z1X isnot good at trade goods.We still have done that here.We had just had a little bit of juice extra.We gave all the minor boost.You should get two or arguably sometimes maybe three bucks for this.You should not get more.You really should not get less.If you're buying someone's buying this for a dollar, that's nuts.That's nuts though.Unless there's like lots of other favors getting factored into it, but I understand thetwo.Oh wait, you're saying it's nuts to sell it for a dollar?I think it's a bit.I think that's such a way to cheat.Wow.You know.That's way too cheap.That's way too cheap.I'm a semi-finalist.Why would you sell it that cheap?You can sell.First of all, you can sell everything for a buck.This is my whole new thing.I understand that, but somebody at the table will buy it for two dollars.I'm sure.Maybe.If you auction it off.You're going to waste everybody's time and pet it around.But can you sell it for a buck?Absolutely.I sell it for a buck.I sell that easy for a buck.I'm just saying opportunity cost.I think you absolutely can also sell it for more.I buy cybernetic enhancements for three bucks because what it can be is I don't have themoney right now for the leadership.I'm going to get trade goods later.I can buy that token.I would have spent three bucks on anyways.It's still an extra token for me.It's just outside of my timing window.I will spend three bucks on cybernetic enhancements.Three dollars for cybernet.If it comes down to it.Crazy.I'm not seeking it out.I'm not trying to spend three bucks on it, but I will.Anyway.I mean, anything can be sold for anything if the buyer is desperate enough.Obviously.But, well, I regularly sell this for a dollar regularly.That's all I'm saying.Wild.That was news to me.That's fun.There's some disagreements here.One of them is now a semifinalist.Technically, we don't really have to list this guy anymore.People like, I've now graduated, okay?Well, I look forward to you playing as one of the semifinals, and then I'm the one with themicrophone.Oh, yeah.No, I fully expect a lot of hate from the commentary desk for game six.Get ready.This guy, if there's a guy that we've been playing arcs lately, this guy got eaten his heartfor me that I forget.I forget about it because we don't really play much.You read it.You're so wrong.You think I'm just coming for you, Hunter Donaldson, and I never am.I never, ever am.I just feel like you, I always, I never know what's going on with you in a game, but you'realways reading what I'm doing.It's like I'm doing a test, and I look up from my scantron, and you were looking rightat my answer.You're looking right at my answer.And I'm like, what?What are you doing?And you're like, yeah.I see what you're doing over there.And I got a plan.And it's just like, yeah, it's like, I don't know, dude.I'm doing that to everybody.I'm doing that to everybody.He pays over there.It'll be like, dude, EJ's over there just like writing outside the line.Yeah, but EJ's not scoring points.And you are.So I'm going to go get your points.EJ's just mucking about in the dirt and like punching us, just punching us all to deathanyways.Well, enough for the next week.Yeah, we're not playing arcs right now.We're playing this game.So tell me about inheritance.Oh my god.This tech that nobody has talked about for three years.It's two yellows.Who cares?You may exhaust this card and spend two resources when you research a technology.Ignore all of that technology's prerequisite.I don't know, man.Tech got better.It used to be in the game.And now it is just not.POK completely deleted it.In base game, it was like one of those things where there'd be like weirdos would belike, actually, it's pretty cool.Yeah.No, it's not cool.It's dead.It's done.We don't talk about this anymore.It's over.It deserves an Omega.It is really the thing.Yeah, it really could.It'd be fun for it to get some sort of Omega that like brings it back into the fold becauseit's I genuinely, like I said, I'm not not only if I not seen someone research, I've notseen someone utter its name in years.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah, it's like L4 disruptors level of just like, dude, nobody, what are you even doing?If you research this, you are try hard.And I'm going to talk smack on you real bad right away.Even before you use it, it'll just be like, wow, what a door.Right over here.I mean, if you get to Faction Tech, you should get rid of two Faction Tech secret and geta new secret objective.Like genuinely, I would advise that over this, probably.Yeah.Yeah, I think so too.Okay.There are other one though is the upgrade for those super dreadnoughts, super dreadnoughttwo, the cost is four, the combat has been brought down to four.The movement is up to two.The capacity has stayed at two.The bombardment has been brought down to four and that bombardment is hair row that happensafter every round of ground combat.Mm hmm.Yeah.And L1Z1X fleet as far as punch potential, as far as that knuckle, that those knuckles onyour fist.Yeah.Some of the best knuckles you can get.I mean, in all, it's like war sons, but we have more soaks, so it's better than war sonsactually.I mean, it's, I would say even a lot better for the most part.Nobody punches like L1.They're the best puncher in the, in the game.Now are they the best soaker?Nope.And once more important, defense or offense, defense, maybe every time defense, defense, defense.Well, let's talk about their leader suite.Let's talk about their agent.One, four, eight, S, the enhancer, prodigy.I love that you can still, for the other races, every soldier killed on the battlefield isa loss.Their experience, their training and their warrior prowess are all spent.For we, the L1Z1X, every soldier killed is a chance to resurrect them into a form evenmore powerful than before.This is a weird bit of flavor text because I don't know.I didn't know that there was necromancy going on with the L1Z1X.I feel like every card of L1 teases something that none of the other texts has suggestedso far.Yeah, I feel like we just don't really get their whole vibe here.And I really think that story wise, the necrovirus existing is pretty obnoxious as far aslike flavor and feel.It feels like we have two factions that sort of have the same vibe.Right.Okay, the L1 is more eldritch and then the necrov is more pure cyber.Yeah, I guess so.Right, or is it really all it does is calls the necrovies whole argument into question becauseit sounds like they didn't like what's wrong with any of the biotics when we can justapparently we're making robot zombies.So I'm not sure what the problem is.Well, what's the ability of the ability is after a player activates a system.You may exhaust this card to allow that player to replace one of their infantry in the activesystem with one mech from their reinforcements and every person who has played post POKL1 for the first time has misunderstood quite exactly what this ability is saying.Yeah, so the infantry has to already be sitting on the planet and then you activate it andthen you turn it into a mech.No, it's it.Honestly, here's what it is.I think Dane got really insecure about there being five infantry start for L1.So he came up with two reasons for there to be five infantry on the planet.This agent because you left one because you went to two to planet systems and then alsothree planet systems.Right.So there were basically two things.Dane was like, ah, ah, actually, there being five infantry on the planet was becausefor two reasons that you just didn't know yet.Okay, I know everything.All right.It was always planned since the days of third edition when I think that this starting fleetwas decided.I don't remember how many I need to look up and see how many starting fleets changed betweenthird and fourth edition, but I think it's surprisingly few.Our commander is to our AM, the integrated systems engineer.Our unlock is to have four dreadnoughts on the game board.We start with one.So we got to spend 12 bucks.We got to spend $12 to get this thing out of the box.We want us.We want to spend that money.The flavor, the newly integrated network flared to life and the warships guns spoke withone voice.The planetary shield flared and died under the concentrated barrage.This is the thing that is so insane to me that L1 got the ability here is units thathave planetary shields do not prevent you from using bombardment.This was like a wish.We asked for this and then got it.I feel like we would be like, man, the only thing that really shuts L1 down is planetaryshield.Then it also felt like in general because of mechs, planetary shield also isn't that bigof a deal ability though.It used to be because you didn't have mechs, you had planetary shield.You could sort of just be like, all right, it's just infantry, the infantry that decidedto die this and I got space cannon defense.So planetary shield was very much like, dude, we are pretty safe.Yeah, you need like three extra infantry to come to this planet.The conflict over whatever I have, you need three plus X plus three infantry to invade.Now it's just like, yeah, no, but L1 actually never, ever, ever cares because you absolutelyunlock this.Maybe not right away, but by the time you need to start doing the invasions, this is onlineevery time.I just wish in, had we had this ability in base game, this would have really been huge.And yeah, and now it's just not because planetary shield is just not a super important aspectof the game anymore.But it is, I'd rather be able to turn it off than not.It's not like I'm saying, oh, this is bad, but I remember the first time reading thisparticular component and being like, L1 is about to pop off, baby.And I didn't consider all the other stuff that changed, you know?Our hero is the dark space navigation diaspora, the helmsman, the last record.You just kind of read all that.It's for, it's for, it's for, it's for things to say on every hero and none of it makes anysense ever.Well, yeah, because there's a front in a back and they have different names on the front,different names on the back.I don't know why.I love.I don't know why we do that because we don't do it with the commander of the agent.We do it with the heroes.Information flooded.The captain's mind from the cable plugged into his cyber cortex.The records of the lost hall of cartography, Velsed, hissed, hewss them well.Is that it?Did I hiss that time?How do you hiss a sentence?I don't know.I don't know.I mean, the records of the lost cartography use them well.I didn't like that.You don't need to do that.This is confirmation that Velsed exists though.Isn't that fun?In Meta.In this episode, we set up a mystery and we were able to solve it in POK.I'm not enough people mentioned this.I'm kind of one of the big lore heads in the community.You do notice this thing.Yeah, where's your eight hour YouTube video uncovering all the secrets of Velsed?Dude, dude, don't tempt me because that would be really funny.I mean, to just put out a way too long YouTube video breaking down the lore of TwilightImperium, but I'm getting all the details wrong.Finding mysteries where none exists just doesn't know.There's no question about what happened.Let's talk about the hero's ability.As an action, choose one system that does not contain other players' ships.You may move your flagship and any number of your dreadnoughts from other systems intothe chosen system then purge this card.Yes.The only drawback there, of course, being one system that does not contain other playerships.That's a toughy, don't love it.But this ability went through a lot of reworking when this came out.This was an ability that didn't work very well and then we got it fixed.Now you can move, of course, lock down stuff, you can carry stuff, whatever.You're pretty unlimited.The only thing is, yeah, there can't be other players' ships.We're going anywhere, anywhere we want to go.It's very good.It is the best thing they got in POK, I would say.In games where L1 is at the table, the other players, the rest of the factions, gum, morethan they normally would.That is the thing.That is the thing.Especially those three systems adjacent to your home system, stuff needs to go there ina pretty major way.I'd love you if Mahawk and L1 are in the same game and Benedictine gets to just pull stuffout of the system right before this ability pops off.That is the ugliest, nastiest, win-slaying combo that exists, basically.Yeah.Okay.Let's get into our hard hats on.Let's get into the real deep stuff.This is the stuff that everybody is actually here for.I want to talk about strength.We got a great home system.It's a one-planet home system.That's good for defense.We got five resources.That's good for production.Also, it's just good to have five resources.It sucks that we don't have any influence, but whatever.We got a great starting unit situation.I would say as far as value, not to talk that kind of language.I don't love that language, but it is important that we have two C4i and that we have superdreadnought.Those are both good things.We would have loved a trade ship, but whatever.We have the production of seven units is incredible for us.I would say because we start with a five resource home system, the diplomacy card has a specialimportance for the L1Z1X ironically.It's weird.The most diplomatic faction of them all is the science zombies we've been talking thiswhole time are out to kill everyone.Yes.The big top line thing for the L1Z1X, and we've sort of already alluded to it.It won't be the last time we'll say it in this episode.We got the best kit in the game for win slaying.Ben addiction, the myhawk ability is probably the best individual component for win slaying.However, this as a kit, as far as what is it designed to do, assimilate, hero, the commander,the hero, right?It all comes together for a unique setup that encourages and enhances the violence wemight do against other players.Hero means we can flip a lot of invasions our way.We can flip a lot of close ones our way.The flagship helps us chew through large HP fleets.Turns a lot of fleet compositions off.Notably the only one that kind of doesn't is like Barony basically.We do a lot of damage.With the hero, we can pretty much not always, but with a little bit of finagling.It's some very solid win slay positioning going in round five, which is very important.I just feel like our performance in a situation as far as win slay goes is exceptional.We were just talking about the meta who has made it to the finals this year.And last year, the meta's game in the semifinals was all about showing off how much win slaythe L1 can do.And it is a whole heck of a lot.We even get four home systems.Or home systems.We even get our mechs for free.This is a minor detail, but they just give us, here's the mechs, just have them.And I mean, yeah, it's a little bit awkward, a little bit clumsy to get them all out there,but it's cool that on top of everything else, they get that.And yeah, I love a one planet home system.We even start with a PDS, which is kind of a minor detail, but it's definitely worth thinkingabout in terms of how secure is L1 when they have the win that up?Very, very secure.I wanted to harp on one thing of those strengths that I just feel like is worth spelling out,which is that thing of we can take out.The way our flagship works, because the one argument almost against it is like, well,fighters still exist in the fight.You still do the whole space combat, but the point being, what are fighters for?Fighters are HP to protect your high rolling units so that the cruisers and the dreads scorethe hits.So the whole point is, if your flagship is in it and knocks out the things that roll ona five and a six and a seven right away, yeah, there's still a lot of HP to choose through,but now they're scoring a hit every other round or whatever.It becomes a ground combat for them and you're still rolling fours on all of your units.You still just chew through everything.Yeah, you're good at chewing through that stuff.You're good at basically taking a space combat and saying, even if I lose, I won, actually,basically.And that's important because L1, a lot of times, you end up thinking about them in termsof big fleet battles in the late game, but they're just as good at skirmishes because of thatflagship.They're just good at going into something and being like, yeah, your fighters might killme, but your ships are dead.I got them.And until it's getting used, that flagship is an amazing defensive tool because that'sthe whole thing about Graviton, right?Is nobody can just send carriers at your space.I mean, it's one system, so let's not overblow it, but wherever that flagship is, it'snot really going to get attacked.Nobody can bring the fleet it needs to bring to take that out.But that all being said, and hey, that all sounds very exciting and very cool.But what is the problem here?Well, being good at war, violence, and hurt in your friends, and slaying is not exactlythe most important pillar of what makes an S-faction or an A-faction.I would say the most important pillar has always been economy.What is our economy like?It's not good.It's not exactly terrible.The way I would describe their economy problem is that it's bad at producing trade goods,and trade goods are your best resource.They are the currency.They are the US dollar of the international marketplace where you would much like to turnyour money into that US dollar, or at least right now.I don't want to be too America-centric with this.If you have a bunch of Japanese yen, it would be cool to turn it into the US dollar rightnow.The end is very weak.I don't know if you know this, but that's the thing right now.If you listen, this is a time to go to Japan right now, people, if you want to visit.I would say at the L1, they have trouble getting that.Their five resource home system is cool, but we have no real value for getting trade goods.We got a promissory note.That's worth between one and two dollars, according to people on this podcast, although in adesperate situation, Matt would spend three.Even still, given that, I don't think even you, Matt, I don't think you're saying somebodyshould give you three dollars or four every round.No way.Absolutely.I'm talking, yeah, just be clear.Just like a, that's like a, "Winnew's desperate enough that I need it."It's also that thing of, "I wish it was not in soul's hands again.I really would like it to be in my hands.I'm going to pay the stupid premium that is bad so that it's at least mine."It's worth the value I would have paid for the command counter anyways.We just don't have a route for that.Really.Two commodities and a promissory note that at least gets sold, but the value of it is difficultto finagle.Starting tech and the faction tech have like almost zero synergy, which is obnoxious.The starting tech has synergy to like what we do.Plasma scoring obviously goes along with bombardment.We even started the PDS though if we got a little space cannon, synergy there.But the faction tech are level two yellow and then a unit upgrade that is two blue and yellow.We just don't start with anything like that at all.It's obnoxious.Basically inheritance systems like we said before is a non-starter at this point.Give me your hot takes if you got them because I will turn the heat up a little bit on thosein progress.The problem is I know you don't actually have them.I know you'll come on the discord and you'll make an argument for it, but you've neverused it.You've never actually researched it.So don't get to come at me.I don't care about that.No, no, no.Listen, daddy's in charge.I'm not threatened by you.I'm a semi-finalist.I'm one of the top 36 players in the world at this game.If I make it to the finals, you're never going to hear me shut up about it.If I win the entire tournament, I quit this podcast and start my own competing podcast.That's what happens.I leave Matt to, I just completely cut myself off and it's just a podcast where I just sitand talk for three hours.Space breaks.Space breaks.Genius turtles.That's what we're doing.One last thing I want to talk about with problems though is that I feel like one thing Idon't love about the kit is that because the hero specifically states, black, ship, anddreadnoughts, we are so married to the dreadnought.And I understand it thematically, but sometimes I do wish that we were maybe not trying to,you know, it's like you got a hammer.Yeah.And now you think everything is a nail.And that's kind of the L ones problem.Now sometimes you open, you pull that, you don't draw open.A lot of nails in there and you're like, this is a hammer time, you know, but a lot oftimes it's not.It's not a lot of, not really hammer time.And you're just over there like, well, I'm good at this.I'm poor.Okay.That's not what we're doing this time.And it's like, dang, well, I'm really good at that.And it's like, that's fine.It's not today.Again, they are an S tier faction for some other game.And they just happen to be here with us.And I love them to pieces.Okay.I know I just had to kind of, you know, crap on them a little bit there, but I love these guys.These guys are my buds.They are, they are Sardak nor, but even more myopic than Sardak nor basically.Sardak nor has more versatility, but isn't as good anything, you know?Right.Sardak nor is worse, but at least has a little more juice, you know, as far as like, oh,what can we do?We got a couple things here that we could finagle.All one is like, I punch and I punch and I punch and that's it.Do I do anything else?No, I have no other abilities.I'm just punching.I have no skills or assets.Well, let's learn what you think we should do with them after a quick break.Yeah.[Music]Spacecaps Nation, I'm proud to say that the first online tournament is upon us.For all November patrons at any tier level, you'll be granted access to a special

scheduling on the 12th.For more information, check out our November 1st bonus episode of the Spacecaps PeaceStartles podcast or our Patreon post for all of the glorious details.[Music]Okay, well, something I feel like we actually, I feel like by this point after covering thecomponents, there's usually a better sense of what we are intending to do as the faction,but since all we've said so far is probably punch good and not know what else to do, I dothink that leaves me even more like, okay, so what is round one supposed to look like asthis faction?What strategy cards?What are we doing with each strategy card?How do we get this kit online?I think we do have a really reliable round one, but it has a low ceiling is what I wouldsay.That's how I would describe it.We can get, I'm not worried about us fumbling into round two, but I think there's lessroom than average for a magical fun opening.We can start off with leadership.I think leadership is kind of a middling option and we have a kind of unlikely high tier, butI do like that if we have leadership and Diplo is for sure going to be in play, then weget to follow tech, Diplo, and warfare.That's a nice start.I just, and then also we get ahead on tokens.We're getting another, we're throwing one token in a strategy and those other two we'rejust getting on the house and we don't start with any influence.We're like, that's kind of chill, I'm not against this.The problem is that you don't know if Diplo is going to be taken before leadership a lotof times you don't.If you take Diplo now, you also control the timing of Diplo, which is pretty powerful.I feel like what happens is because of the traditional understanding of the order thatstrategy cards get taken.The reason leadership takes a little bit of a hit in my mind is because if you take leadershipand then last pick is construction and not Diplo, I feel like you've done kind of a sillything that is not really too helpful.You literally only have two ships.You know what I mean?You don't even have a third ship to send to somewhere.What are these tokens for?I guess just investing into the mid game, which you might need to do if you have a reallylow influence slice, which that's why I say it's middle.If you might need it, it might be a good decision.It might become your only real other downside is like if you're economy, you're alreadydescribing situation where your economy is not so great.If part of that bad economy is also not a lot of influence in your slice, you're actuallyin a lot of trouble.That's going to be one of those though one games where it's like, oh, you didn't do anythingall game because you got a token per round or whatever.Yeah.I would say we don't do a section on map building because everybody is too much culturethere to cut through.I want these to at least make sense in an abstract.I don't want to insist that people always act like we insist that everybody play thesame way that we do.The only thing we insist on is we write these for six players.I think that's pretty much it.Besides that, I'm like, whatever.It's hilarious that we now get a little bit of flack in my or most recent guy.I suggested some multi draft strategies.If you're doing that because I don't know if a tournament that uses multi drafts,so a lot of people in our community use that.He's not.What I think about all of that is we used to get flack for not giving any particular adviceof any direction.It was people were annoyed that we were being generalist about it.The second I was like, okay, well, everybody plays multi draft actually, so all at leastfeed to that crowd.Then the four non-military drafts were like, what about my version?Right.Well, okay.That's enough about leadership and map building.Well, I guess I will say that my little bit of map building stuff is like you do want tohigh influence slice.You just do.It's one of your only weaknesses that we didn't talk about in problem selection is yougot no influence at home.You got to do something about that.You can't just make it work with just plastic.You got to have them token.You do not want a biz-free in your slice.That is way too much money.A biz is going to get a plus two on it as well.You'll have a five zero a biz and a five zero home planet and no tokens to do anythingwith all that plastic.Not good, not good.Diplomacy, I'm going to put it high to here.I'm going to say may even be like my third or second favorite card that you can pick asL1.It gives you a couple things.It's multifaceted.The most obvious thing is we have a five resource home system that we would love tospend on tech and then again on plastic, okay?Those are both those are good.I like that when you take Diplom, you get a little bit of say in the order of things becausewe would love to maximize our value and get as much done in round one as possible.The more plastic we get down, the better we're going to be doing in round two and three.Because we are Mr. Puncher face, getting that plastic down is very important if we wantto exercise any advantage at all.I mean, because we have no latent advantage without the plastic on the board, we are doingnothing at all.We are just dying slowly.So I like Diplom quite a bit.The other thing I will say that is good about it is if we have the skips we need, whichwe're very, oh, we're so limited.We're really just a blue skiff or yellow skiff action.Basically, that's kind of it for us because we start with a green and a red.It's like, what are we even doing?So I mean, that's sad, but if you got that, make use of it and Diplo will help you dothat.So I feel like he got three good reasons to be like, yeah, Diplo round one is L1 is great.I pretty much end up taking Diplo, considering Diplo is L1 pretty much the entire game.There's not a round.I wouldn't think about it a little bit.Well, you have the highest possible opportunity for Diplo, Diplo of any faction because ofthe five planet homes.For guaranteed, at least the five bucks, which some factions, that's their max for Diplo.Three bucks is, I mean, five total dollars between two planets is what a lot of people aretrying to get with Diplo.You're doing that plus whatever else is in your slice.So it's like, absolutely.The only person you can make an argument for a better Diplo is Barony and that's reallyonly around one consideration because Barony has the like two juicy planets at home thatthey can, you know, you spend six bucks twice without even taking any other planets.That's cool.Like L1's five bucks is all game long.It's a good Diplo always.Well, and yeah, and then if they have, if they happen to have a three resource planet nearthem, then it's, well, we're talking about this is crazy in here, getting crazy in here.And we've got the production to back it up is beautiful, right?Let's talk about politics.Politics bad, not good.We have zero influence at home and no blue starts.So we bad.We don't, we start with neural, so we already get action cards, like, I don't know.There's no rush here, people.And I just don't see a lot of situations where you're going to have fixes to those problems.So therefore, custodians is not really on the table, which is part of why you are bad.Now, obviously, like I have to say every time we have these discussions, if you can fixall of these problems and get custodians do it, do not, not do it, do that.I think that a lot of times politics is an earlier pick.A lot of times you're not going to have enough information to know for sure if everythingis going to work out for you.The world in which you take politics and are looking down the barrel of, well, I can followtech or warfare.And that's it.And I will have five, five resources.Oh, I'll get a trade good.Well, maybe two trade goods.Maybe.That's bad.Yeah.That's a bad, that's not good.But, Hunter, you got two action cards.No.And you got to see the agenda, though.No, no, no, no.I'll get a poll later.I'm good.I think politics is quite bad for you.And I love politics.Politics is my favorite card.I'm always playing that speaker game.But with L1, no, thank you.No, no, no, no.Construction also low tier.Yeah, we can get structures from other players if it comes to it.You know what I mean?And you may as well.If you're going to, again, we got, we are all we're given.It's like you show up to a game and it's like, dang, what did you give me?And it's like, dang, you know, gives the Hakan like, here's a briefcase full of money invarious currencies.Oh, have fun, my friend.You know, Titans is like, oh, you're going to get cruisers with more defense and PDS withmore defense.And then it's time for L1 is just, he hands you a switchblade.He's just like, you're going to have to do a lot with that.We figure it out.Yeah.You're going to figure it out now.So I say this, do not waste any of your tokens on getting extra structures down.I think if structure objectives come out, you go to war, my friend, because you will win.That's the whole thing.You may as well get as sort of latent advantage of saying, no, I do not follow constructionand I don't take it.You take it and then I take your stuff.That's my advantage that I get, okay?So then your neighbors are like, I guess we're never taking construction either because Idon't want it.And then now guess what?We're all as bad as L1.No, we got ahead.There we go.You win again.Trade is obviously good.I mean, when is trade bad, but obviously it's good.It's, I will even concede that it's better than diplomacy, okay?You're going to get a little more leverage.I feel like in everything, it's pretty annoying that we don't have a trade ship if you taketrade, but will, you know, if you have debt meta in your crew, you will get more moneyoverall.I just, I do want to throw out just sort of the mathematical argument here for why tradeis not always actually necessarily better than Diplo.We already talked about how Diplo can easily be eight bucks.Trade is three trade goods and all of this is setting aside that trade goods are better,okay?And I understand that and that's why then trade gets elevated.But yeah, to just raw numbers and especially in round one, I take trade, I get three bucks,I replenish my quantities.I have two of those, okay?So I'll get, I'll try to get those washed.I don't have a trade ship.I have to get people to come to me, right?Okay, I washed my two things and then I'm trying to get X minus ones.Okay, so to match my eight bucks from Diplo, I need three of the five other players to cometo me with money.Now I can, they can owe me more money later.So in theory, trade is like a little bit more extra kick down the line and that's whereit then is better.But if you need to do stuff round one and you have a three resource planet in your sliceor whatever, like Diplo, there is, there are situations where Diplo is raw dollars betterthan what trades get you because you don't have that trade ship because you might not havethe wormholes to get those neighbors or whatever.Right.And I will say this is an interesting situation if you are, let's say your first pick,you could pick trade and I would say that that would 100% of the time not be a bad pick.You're going value town on it.That's not necessarily how I like to think about it, but there is a situation where you takediplomacy and the next player takes trade.And if one of your neighbors is going to have trade and you're going to have Diplo 100%of the time, that's going to be worth it, I think.I definitely think that that is absolutely going to be worth it.But I don't really like to think of this in terms of, you know, being super dependenton what the other players are going to pick what the other players are going to do.I mean, I would say this to the flip side to my whole argument is if I have Diplo, I knowtrade is in play.I make eight bucks off Diplo and I make a dollar off of trade because of the X minus onesucks.If I have trade, I might make six to seven dollars and I'll still Diplo if Diplo is inplay, like I'll still also make it.That is exactly what I'm saying.I can still Diplo.I can't still trade.So, you know, it does, in fact, go both ways.I think it's really just that L one with trade goods is an L one that has circumvented theirhuge drawback for sure.So in that reason, I think it take the trade goods over the raw value most of the time.However, we do have other options, other things we can talk about, like for example, warfare,which is bad, we shouldn't take it.We want somebody else to take it.We have two C4i coming out the gate.I do not need to, I don't need to over expand as L one.I prefer a stronger rollout with better plastics so that we can be a bully if we need to bearound three.I would love to be around three bully as L one.And warfare, in my opinion, is not going to help us do that.In fact, just going to encourage us to spread thinner and look weaker.Okay.We already have, as far as economy stuff going on at home, we already have a decent setup.And we have a need for Diplos.So I just can't see a reason why.If anything, let warfare be not taken and just say like, okay, well, things are going to getrowdy for me round two because I'm going to be coming out with, I'm going to get togravity drive and I'm going to have done a massive bill at home, bigger than anybody else'sbill.I'm going to have to do the same kind of expansion.I'm going to have the most plastic in round two because my production is so strong.I will say this, the last one is technology.And I hate it, but I think it's your best option because double-tacking as L one really helpsI think to overcome your bad tech start.And we're very tech dependent.We need a lot of tech basically.In order to make all the rest of our kits sing, we pretty much need super dreads.Honestly, it would be even great if we got carrier two.And in order to do that, I'm already talking like one, two, three, four, five tech.I hate that.If I have to say that, oh, you need five tech to be good, that's actually bad.I've got people.That's not good.I mean, I know Jadim Jedi is out there just being like, no, take tech every time, doubletech every time.That's the only thing that matters is just do that.But it does to me seem like it's worth it and you will always might look out and someof might take Diplo and then you're having the best time you're having such a good time.Because that hilarious tradeoff too is we keep talking, I mean, I know we're not harpingon it because it's not the biggest deal in the world.But to do the second area tech means essentially burning a dollar.You spend the five.You hopefully Diplo up back.It's all fine.It's not a big deal.But if we can just take that five and how we need is our like one trade good from trade.We can just get that one dollar.We can yeah, solve this tech start and then hopefully Diplo also was in play and like weactually are out nothing.We got two tech and we built a pretty grave.That's the dream.Yeah.That's the dream right there.That's the dream.To your point at the start of this is they don't have like some huge mountain declines.They don't have some amazing thing they can accomplish.Their best thing they can accomplish is like DET gravity drive and like a good amountof plastic round one.And you took two systems good for you.Yeah.We'll say there are some tables where I think your best bet is maybe even going to beDiplo.If the vibe of your table is like very cutthroat.If you don't do debt meta.If there's not a lot of desire for if trade is like kind of not much of a factor at all,then you're I think most like independent choice is Diplo.I will say that.But technology is the only one where I'm like, oh, we can break through into it.We could make the ceiling even higher.And we could really come out of this ahead.It's kind of like politics custodians except for with politics custodians.I'm like, well, a lot of things are going to have to go right and you might be stuck withnothing.With tech at least we got tech for free.You know, you know, it's a more interesting.This is purely anecdotal.There's absolutely no stats behind it.But I would just note that the L1 games that I feel like I have seen that were the successfulL1 games.Something that happened in the commentary desk was my God.Why does L1 have so much tech?Yep.The games where L1 finally actually pops off is when they they over invested in technologyand they looked like Jol-Dar and Necro.They're just sitting out there.I mean, I remember I'm pretty sure there's like an old like J-Hon game where it's like J-Honhad two or four colors.Like he just went to have crazy and was like deeply in the running for that game.It was in base game even that wasn't even that wasn't even a POK thing.That was an in an tournament game against me.He scored two and four colors and had eliminated a root as Nalu, right?I remember.It was a crazy game.I mean, yeah, there's been so many crazy L1 games.Like more so than most factions, there's been a lot of like notable crazy times where itwas like, wow, L1 has really popped off.But yeah, so there you go.There's your strategy card analysis.Obviously we're not going to talk about Imperial as nothing to say ever.There's never anything to say about it.We should have something for that guy.Yeah, we need something.We need some reason for that to happen.You know, like what is the point of it not?But let's talk about tech path.I mean, you just you just mentioned, let's I'm trying to keep this tech path from going theway of like a Jol-n-R episode because we are we are really not that guy.We would love to find tech tempo and we would love to get a whole bunch of tech, but I'mwriting this assuming that you're not going to have a good time with tech.If you do get all of the tech, I'm going to tell you to get and then whatever you want,all kinds of stuff.There's lots of it.There's so much to get.All the spaghetti at the wall, just not inheritance systems.Okay, be real.But yeah, don't be shy if it's if you're getting good tech tempo, but you're not guaranteedthat.Please recognize those players out there that are going to critique the tech section.Please recognize that maybe you had a game or you just got a lot of tech.That's going to happen sometime, right?Okay, core tech.I've just got three that I'm going to say are the core tech gravity drive super dread toarea two.Welcome to space.Yeah, sorry, everyone.Yep, I'm, I'm, but literally this action like tells you this is actually screams at youto do it.Okay, this is not just like a, well blue text pretty good.L one has two things going for it.And the nuts and the home system that can produce a ton of stuff and you know what holds aton of stuff carriers carrier to specifically.Rocket science y'all.We need the gravity drive for the flagship as well.So I mean, whatever it's gravity drive has early game and late game pay off.This is just, this is how it goes sometimes.Let's talk paths.I got a no skip path for you right now that I just hate, but we're going to talk aboutit.So it's anti mass slash D T. You know, we've been here before gravity drive starwing slash scan link.I actually kind of like star wean maybe a little bit better actually scan link obviouslymight get you more stuff, but there's something about L one where I'm just I'm so interestedin pumping out units that all even be like whatever I'll put four resources down now andget my rebate or whatever and consider that a good day.Red to carrier to and then after that, it's deep blue into the finish.And that's our no skip path.And it's just not screwing around.Right.It's not fun.If we get it, our late game will be popping off, but that is one, two, three, four, five,and then I mean, three more.I don't know.That's a lot of tech.Right.There are five rounds of the game.If you secondary each time that's five tech, that's it.That's that's not enough.I will say your big goal, you said anti mass or D T in the argument is always, I mean,if you have the master field, you should do the anti mass, but they're the D T.Is of course, don't forget the tech that can help you get more tech for six dollars ofwhich you're pretty good at spending that six bucks on time.So we're going to have a minor philosophical nightmare actually.And yeah, I'm really going to have this one.So here's the problem is that actually I kind of lean anti mass is L one because if thereare any asteroid fields anywhere, as a matter of the end, your slides.In fact, actually, maybe if they're in your slides, I'd be like, well, whatever, don'tworry about it.If there's anti, if there's, if there's asteroid fields, somewhere, I see where we'rein.I'm candidates for the hero.Yeah.Other people probably aren't getting anti mass besides like two people on the board.Some of them started with it, but yeah, yeah, those are the, those are right for the pickand have places that people didn't put stuff in.Yep.Yep.And wasn't it, I forget, wasn't there, wasn't eventually like the ruling on the hero atsome point was that you could use it to circumvent anti mass.No.And I got changed or was that not a thing?I don't, I think that was an argument proposed, but I don't think the, the, I don'tthink it ever.No wording ever about that that way.Yeah.What it, what it did you to do is you couldn't go into a nebula for some reason.There was a point time where you just straight up couldn't helmsman into a nebula becausenebula is had to be tactical action moved into, but that's way too fiddly and move gotchanged basically.Yeah.We got rid of that.You're welcome, y'all.Okay.But that's your no skip path.I hate it.Yellow skip path.I'm going to say an early cruiser too does have a little bit of room, a little bitof a room for me in the L1 Z1X situation.So we would cruiser two first using that yellow skip, hopefully off Diplo again.We're going to be taking Diplo a lot.Like I think Diplo is just kind of the regular opening for these guys.But we get that cruiser too because we can just slam that in their normal style.And then having a yellow skip is also going to be good for getting us dread twos lateron.We get cruiser two for some early functionality.And then we just kind of resume the no skip path.So it's still even the same amount of tech we have to get.We just end with a cruiser two instead of a Sarawain/Skamp.Like we're going to have to use that yellow skip twice, which could be annoying if it'slike similar or something like that.That's what I got for y'all.And after that, I'm not.Listen.You want to sound off in the comments about how you got transit diodes and you had a goodtime, I believe you.All right.I'm not trying to take away your experience here.But when it comes to thinking about tech with these guys, it is like the thing that I alwayswant them to have so much of it.And I just, I'm kind of wanting to be tech conservative on this podcast today.Small C conservative is what I want to be right now.Okay.You go ahead and be small L liberal about it.Okay.But I'm going to be a small C conservative.And that is small C conservative.Okay.Do not, you know, I'm not going on Newsmax.I'm talking about cruiser too.Yeah.I, again, to reiterate what we said earlier, the whole point here being you can have gameswhere you can pop off with tech.But the whole thing with that is great.Get all of the good tech we are always talking about.Like there's not a different trick is the point.Yeah.There's not a different weird, funky trick that L1 takes advantage of.They're good, they are made better if they move faster and hit even harder.Yeah.I had kind of not very much fun writing this tech path thing because here's what I did.I was like, I was like, okay, let's talk.I was trying to, I was thinking about stuff like bio stems.I was like, bio stems school because like we already loved, I mean, it's like part of whywe love diplos that we can, you know, bio stems and planets and skips and stuff.And then I just kind of rode out like that, that no skip path.And was like, wow.That's too much tech.It's just like, how can I possibly recommend more?Yeah.And it would be silly to recommend more is ultimately what I realized.But are there other techs that are going to work?Absolutely.I agree.But not, you know, not that we're really going to talk about right now.But let's talk about the blue skip path.This is probably my favorite one.We can get grab drive around one with diplo.Let's just take dip, if I have a blue skip in my, take diplo, don't make it complicated.Right.Don't mess up, you know, just take diplo.You know, don't even count on somebody else taking it.Just take it yourself so you can determine exactly when it pops off everything.And then that way you can get grab drive right away, love it.And then I think from there, you can pick AI, AI dev up and actually have a pretty goodtime because we can AI dev blue skip into dread twos and we can AI dev into carrier two.And then just kind of throw in whatever unit upgrades we want.Right.Okay.And then you skip to hop on into fleet log and lightweight.I'm saying if we have a blue skip, let's skip every round.Let's skip all the time with it basically.Right.Or at least as often as we can come up with to do that.And that's, yeah.And then green skip.No.Hunter, you can get hyper metabolism and solve your command counter problem.Nope.You could know, but you could red skip.No.Yeah.Inheritance systems.No.Not doing it.No, I'm talking about it.War Sons.No.Not actually this week.No war Sons.Hard.No.I do not want to talk about war Sons.You literally are a faction that's built from the Dane sat in a room being like, I wantto make a faction that doesn't care about war Sons.You have every reason to not care about war Sons.You are, I'm going to call L1Z1X literally the worst war Sons faction in the game becauseit's like it would be like if someone handed you a Swiss army knife and then you tried tosell it for a steak knife.You have a knife that does all kinds of things and all you want is a steak knife.That's good for literally cutting steak and that's it.Okay.Do not bother me with War Sons talk this week.Okay.I will not be bothered.With L1's commander, to give L1 War Sons is like giving men tech and ability that letsthem use their planets better as opposed to like more trade goods.It's like what?Yeah.So you could double the value of your trade goods.So anyways, like your planets are a little bit better across the board.Yeah.That didn't feed into my thing at all.Yeah.Yeah.So sorry y'all, but this is the tech path situation I got for you.I mind Palace to this one for a while and failed to come up with anything super exciting.I will admit that freely.I don't even think they particularly have time for fun stuff like sling ray.You know, like we are just kind of, because Lightwave is pretty important for the wholewin-slave thing.We didn't actually say Lightwave's name by deep blue.I mean, Lightwave.We would love to end every game with Lightwave, but listen to how much tech that is.Right.That is just too right?Right.We listen to this cool Helmsman into the immediate attack.There's no one can follow up on you at all.Except that is seven technologies.Right.Some people are going to argue that you don't need dread to and they are playing a riskygame, I would say.That two movement on the dreads is really important to make the win-slave go a longway.If you don't have super dread to, you don't need Lightwave.I would, is the way I would put it the other direction.Oh yeah.And then what are you getting?Like then what are you even doing?I don't know.You're just not really doing as much stuff.So.At the point where I decide whether or not I need dread to is before round five whenI find out whether I for sure need it.Does that make sense?Like, I think I have to get dread to because of the great unknown of the final setup ofthis game.Yeah.And then maybe I didn't need to get it.But I'm not going to tell you to not get it.Right.Because that is not very good advice.You need to always get it.You don't always have to have gotten it.Yes.Yep.And that's a, yo, that's Twilight Imperium right there.That is such a good summation of Twilight Imperium.It's like a poker thing, right?Like it's like, it's like sometimes your starting hand is, okay, well let's see where thisgoes.It's kind of a bad hand and then it becomes a good one.You know what I mean?And you're like, oh, this actually worked out.I don't know enough about poker to make this work, but you do.And you're not saying I'm wrong.So I feel like it makes sense.I'm just moving on from it.The point is you can't, yeah, you, you, you, you, sunk costs are what they are.And you should do the cost of, of super dread not to and sometimes it might not pan out foryou and that, and that's okay.It's better to have had the opportunity for that to have paid off for you.You're going to win more hands with it than without it.Yeah.You are going to lose some hands.You're super dread not to.Two is the nine of spades, which we have learned is a great little card.And it doesn't always matter, but it's a great little, it's a great little card.Yeah.Cool guy too.Trading and metal.Let's talk about trading meta stuff.From note, we've, we've talked about how much is worth already too much probably.It's, you know, it's, uh, I actually wrote here that maybe in a desperate situation youget to, that's how much I was sure it is worth one.Because I just believe in, in, in everything is worth a buck economy now.So I, I, I undervalue and maybe Matt overvalues and then the truth is somewhere in between us.So I guess two is what it is.Yeah.I think that's, I mean, that is what everybody else does it for.Like the thing that everybody comes to the table with is just like the first person tosay the words, hey, oh, one, two bucks for your cybernetic hand, they just get it.That's the worst part of async.I'll say that much because it's the kind of the same way military support works, butwith cybernetic, there's not going to be another chance this round.So it's literally just like the agenda phases wrapping up and someone's like, oh, hey, bythe way, cybernetic real quick right now in the agenda phase before anybody else eventhinks about it, let's just knock that out and then it's already done.Yeah.Yeah.I will say so as far as above the table stuff is concerned, we are, we're kind of, we'rescary neighbor if we have a lot of plastic.If we're doing good, if we're being diligent about getting things online, we're kind ofa frightening neighbor, but like I said, the game is not about punching people in fact.And so therefore, if that is not actually going to be rewarded, you might not really have,you know, sound and fury signifying nothing essentially.Well, I will say this, I have an easier time, I think, getting people to be nice to me asL one, if I can project possible aggression.You know what I mean?If I'm in such a strong position that they're looking at where I'm at and saying, oh, ifI make unbun mad this game, he can get me there.He can get me there, you know, et cetera, et cetera.I feel like it's kind of a little bit easier to let that sort of project into good relationsand good diplomacy and possibly economic benefits.I will say, you know, I have never been shy about how much I think extortion is bad.And I do think it's bad.I think it's politically not worth it in every game of Twilight Imperium I've ever seenit use.I think it's almost always politically not worth it.And I definitely have even, you know, I'm a hypocrite too.I have, I have extorted people in ways that I think are okay, but I think you take toomany hits in people's hearts or it to be worthwhile.So it's kind of tricky, I would say, to navigate how to use this advantage per se.I like to do a lot of like talking about what points I'm going to score with my neighborsand letting them know that if we can't work something out, I'm going to have to fight.Exactly.I mean, there is genuinely a difference between extortion.Well, especially I want to draw the line of, I think extortion is actually like for somethingyou don't necessarily need.Like extortion is when there wasn't a deal that could be, like you know, there's notgoing to be a deal that can be made.I'm threatening your home system because I know it will take you down a peg, but it actuallykind of gets me nothing, but I know you'll pay up to prevent it.Like that's the nasty extortion to me.And what you're describing is like, why don't we do some point swapping, right?Why don't we move around these planets in a way that is equitable for both of us becausethe alternative is, I mean, it will be bad for you, but I'm not doing this just to makea buck off of you.Give me five trade goods or I take out your home system.Extortion.Hey, right.Why don't you give me quan and I'll let you have Intimateate Council next to the, to the,you know, you can have my space next to mecha tall.We do that little swap.And then it's easy rather than me just taking quan and giving you nothing in return.Yeah.Yeah.I mean, it's, yeah, this is, I think, a better way to make your aggression go farther becausea lot of the times too, even in the really flashy L1 games that we have seen when L1 pullsthe trigger on a really big invasion, especially one that involves an assimilate and then rebuildingand stuff.Sometimes it's a really good strategic move.Like if it's or like shard or something like that, like that's, that's, I, you know, I'mnot gonna, I'm not gonna smack talk that.Yeah.But sometimes if it's just purely for eliminating what I end to see is the L1 game sortof Peter out, there's this burst of excitement.And then it's like, well, what are we going to do now is now they've like dug into anotherslice.Now they have to protect.Yep.And then they have to protect their home system.You just start kind of running out of mobility.Whereas if you sort of project your possible violence, then by the time, then, and kind ofuse that to hopefully stay in the pack, the idea is that once we get to round five andit is win, slay time, we're gonna, you know, kind of raise our flag and say, all right,we'll do it.And even though we're third in line, we're gonna be first at the end, you know, like that's,I think the, uh, lethonic ideal of an L1 game.I do not think you win L1 games by being a number one in line.Like you may as well not be.And you make a stronger argument.I, I think genuinely at the table, like you can, you can make some of these deals of, hey,listen, in round two or three, you don't know, you're probably gonna want me around basically.Yeah.Like as L1, I'm gonna have the tool, like if one person is getting ahead, you're gonna,you're gonna start calling for my stuff.So better for me to have the plastic, have the toolkit ready.I think of L1 as like, it's not that they have one chance to strike big, but they do kindof have like one round.They have like one round to go hard.And then they, they will not follow that up with as much, you know, stuff to do.Yeah, round five.Round five.This is actually, this is actually a core problem of L1 in my opinion is they're so goodat stopping other people.They are like, maybe the cliche to me of the person on warfare that stops everybodyelse doesn't have a win lined up.We go into the next round and actually it was all for nothing.There was nowhere for L1 to go in round six.Right.There was no, they were, they were not going to win off of that.They did in fact stop everybody, but for what goal?Okay.Now Hacon just wins round six or whatever.Jolinar just wins first action around six.Yeah.I, ideally, I think you convinced someone to be kind of your boat floaty, nice person andto help you stay in the pack or you to be in that third or fourth spot, come round fivetime, I think is ideally what you're looking for.So maybe like a Jolinar situation where Jolinar is your neighbor, you're like, hey, I couldreally kind of mess with you.How about we just be friends though?And then they take that up and then you'll do become friends.And even that helps you out with tech tempo then, right?And then, you know, once we get to the end of the game, then it's time to like, okay,well, I punched forward and made it all work.But yeah, I mean, it's really like more important, I think to point out things you could do thanit is to like actually do stuff as L1.Yeah.That makes sense.It's more of the potential energy is going to go further politically than the kinetic energyof, well, I, well, John's out now, you know, right.Jeff is going to go home early, but I guess I'm still going to lose.Well, there you go.So what does our scoring actually look like then in that late game?I mean, if we're, you know, it sounds like we're leaning a lot into the win slate, but towhat, eh, like, what do we pat?What are we, what are we backing that up with?Well, so stage one wise, I mean, well, actually first, let's talk bonus points.We're not good at any of them.We don't really, we have no natural advantage towards any bonus points at all period endof story.We, in fact, have even this advantage of the fact that we don't start with any influenceat our home system means that we're generally also a little worse at agendas.So like, you know, if any agenda points come up, no, not good bad, don't like it.And then custodians, we already discussed we're not good at that, you know, explorationstuff.No, like we just have no, there is no like wiggle room for us.I'm not saying you'll never get any of those.But it's not, you know, I think if we had 100 L1 games in front of us data wise, we definitelysee, oh, yeah, they don't, they're not always finding those.Age ones, I don't love economy.How good are we at those?No, we're bad at them.Structures, like I said, let's leave structures.Let's not invest in them ourselves.And then maybe, you know, kind of make them happen.Although even that is maybe a little too violent.Like I think maybe if I, if I'm really going out of that path, I still probably pick upa structure or two, the old good normal way.And then I take a little extra, but the problem with that strategy is like you are point blockingsomeone and doing something else.So I mean, it's like it's a little bit scary to play this way, but I do like, I generallylike to play L1 as if I will pivot to the structures late via assimilate, maybe even afteranother player scored is maybe the nicest thing to do.But you know, that's suggesting a lot of versatility with points.So we don't always get control.We're good at fighting.And if we get our tech figured out, we can, we're versatile.We can move around.We can get to where we need to go.Yeah.But even when it comes to control objectives, we don't actually start with that many advantages.Like being good at fighting and being good at control objectives are actually not thesame thing at all.Right.Right.Right.And sort of the same thing.Holding the stuff you took.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.Yeah.You know, if there's one bonus point that, you know, it's not a raw big advantage on,but it's a little bit like we can't take it.We can't take mechital from somebody else.And if we have imperial, we can get that bonus point.But it's the like, we are not, you at no point of suggested playing for speaker order tothen get imperial.It's kind of a no.It's like you're always sort of thinking about doing that.But I mean, we have not leaned into that at all yet.And part of I think is because of the same control thing is everybody's looking at mechitala lot of the time.And yeah, one can take it.Can they hold it in round three?I'm specifically talking about, right?Round five, the flagship goes on in it's then also good at defending like whatever.As you're final, as a final point, right?To win the game, you take mechital, you pop it, you score the objective, you get two points,three points in the round, whatever it is.That's like an L one win.But doing it in round three, I don't know, someone else might take mechital from you.Unless the table is like, you know, there's lots of games where everyone is just like chillwith the person with imperial getting mechital.So like, oh, we're not actually that threatened by it for some reason.Yeah, you might be behind.I mean, I've seen a lot of L one games where L one was like behind because of the wrong objectivescoming out.I mean, this has like kind of always been a story with them.Yeah.And then people are like, okay, with you getting back caught up.I mean, I think the whole thing about in order to get your tempo set up with aching mechitalwrecks and then popping imperial, that's almost always like the worst way to do it becauseof the lack of secrets.Not saying you shouldn't do it.And if something being the worst doesn't mean that it's, you know, it's the worstabstractly, but it might be the only.And then you need to do it, you know, so like worst is actually not doing anything and justdying on the line.So worst would just be not accomplishing that at all.If you don't, you cannot win a game of toilet and perium if your tempo is not set up for10 points because you won't get to 10 points.Right.You have to get set up for that.And I would say that my, my other kind of minor issue is that again, it's like, it'slike an abstract thing.Like, yes, that situation you're describing is that always going to come up?Hmm.The objective is kind of to be right, right?We can't just take mechital wrecks and get a custodian's point.We also need to maybe be qualified for two stage one in order for that to go even further,which is rough.I mean, I could see, I could see games where L one is like, all right, well, I'm going totake mechital and I'm going to get my mechital point and I'm going to score my stage one,but I don't have another one in status phase.And that's bummer.But I mean, I still would you, would I do that?Probably.Yeah.It kind of helps segue a little bit into talking about secrets.I do think that L one is pretty good at a lot of the action phases, because again, we'regood at punching.We start with plasma, which is like a cool thing to start with when it comes to, you know,stuff like turn your fleets to dust, make an example.Yes, I realize we got a minor nerf, but we're already so good at it.It's like not a big deal.We can do that.You know, demonstrate your power, brave the void.You know, brave the void is like helped by our hero or hero can like help us like it,you know, it's like, you know, when brave the void is hard because there's not enoughships in anomalies and there's like one destroyer across the board and nebula.You can get over it.The hero will help us get that, you know, that's cool.So I mean, like, we have some advantages there.I think there's still, there's so plenty of annoying secrets for L one.Like we already talked about faction tech is a bummer.Right.I would say even massive laws of physics would be kind of obnoxious.Like, listen, I got to get even more tech, you know what I mean?Like, oh, dear, I'm forced to get these four blue rather than it being like a hopefullygood option if we got rich.Now I'm requiring myself to get rich.Oh, good.Yeah.Oh, good.The thing I didn't want.What about, so I mean, are we sort of saying, and I do feel like I've seen this in practice,like is it a little bit of stage two or bust mentality?Like we are leaning into, we're going to win, slay so hard and score, you know, we're goingto do the L one version of a nomad parade to go just to take a bunch of stuff in the finalround to actually accomplish stage two's other factions have more difficulty with.I think, yeah, I think if we're talking about, if we're talking about a thousand games,I think that I bet if we could look at the data, I think what we would find is thata lot of the times L one is winning because of the win, slay ability, meaning that theirtempo was not good and their speaker order was not great, but that they were able to,and I think that for your own sake in the game, you have to lean into that.I don't mind if I'm playing, if I'm L one and around three, I've already accepted thatI'm in stage two tempo, I'm okay with that because there, yeah, there are a handful ofstage twos that are hard that maybe would be a little bit easier for us, notably thestructure ones we can go a lot further in a final round being like, all right, I'm goingto start stealing all the structures I can get.What's nice about it too is it goes with win slaying because everybody has structures in theirhome system, but you can sort of be like, except for the, there is the outside of home systemone, which is obnoxious.I guess it doesn't even work for both of them, but it works for one of them and hey, I'mgonna take it.I love the, you know, the flagship control one, the rule, distant lands is great for Lone, I have someone else's home system is great for L one.There is single target big stage twos are actually like not a big deal.It's that, yeah, it's like six tech skips.Come on.That's actually still just as hard as you for as it is for everybody else.It depends on the map a little bit.I mean, but yeah, like, generally speaking, if you have your full tech suite online, maybeyou're, maybe you are on that level of striking out, but I think the other thing that maybehasn't been emphasized enough in this, in this discussion is that we do, we have, I mean,the economy problem isn't just about trade goods and scoring.It's also about tokens.It's about command tokens.Right.So a lot of the times, there will be like, okay, this is a stage two that L one has abilityadvantages to, but they don't have the influence to accomplish all right.Right.Yeah, I mean, scary.Our famous example is the meta taking out four, you know, and three other players, homesystems, you know what that required?Three tokens in tactics and probably a few others to get you there to get into all thepositions.You have to be able to do a lot of activations to do all that win slaying.You're not going to do it in a single token.You've got to stock up and accomplish a lot of stuff.Yeah.So I really do want to kind of just make sure to emphasize that like whatever the situationis for you as far as start, you need a high influence slice in order to, you know,to make L one work.And if you do not, I would maybe not play them.Yeah.I think in a tournament situation, I would probably not select L one unless I had, like,unless I knew I'm, I got a blue skip or I've got a lot of influence or ideally both.Ideally, I have both a blue skip and loss of influence.Right.And because I just, I've seen them run out of gas to me times.I play them run out of gas to me times.I have, I have one only like, I played L one a lot in P. OK, I think I, I would rate themas above average as far as how much I've played.M, which would probably be somewhere at this point.That's somewhere around 10 games, I think.Yeah.So, and I can remember winning twice.And I think that's it.I think I've only won twice.That means eight losses as L one, which is pretty bad.How to be fair, like, I have about the same ratio with Sardak and I consider that prettygood.So maybe I should, maybe I should actually split yourself around a bit.Yeah.Actually, I kind of just thought that actually maybe I'm great because that's, you know,it's like it's hard to win as L one in Sardak.
