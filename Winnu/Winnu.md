## I. Introduction

The Winnu are TI4's Mecatol Rex specialists—designed to take and hold MR faster and more efficiently than any other faction. However, they're widely considered one of the weakest factions in the game due to poor starting position (choose-1 tech), average economy, and over-reliance on controlling Mecatol Rex. Winnu demands exceptional political skill, perfect timing, and opportunism to overcome structural weaknesses and leverage their Mecatol Rex advantages.

The payoff? Watching opponents realize you took Mecatol Rex R2 without spending influence (Blood Ties), seeing your Commander give +2 combat in MR system making you nearly unkillable there, and using your Hero to perform any strategy card primary at the perfect moment. When you control Mecatol Rex and defend it successfully, victory comes through Imperial points and superior MR positioning.

## II. Playstyle

Playing Winnu is like being the rightful heir to an empty throne. Your Blood Ties lets you remove custodians from Mecatol Rex without spending 6 influence, your Reclamation places free PDS + space dock on MR after taking it, and your Commander gives +2 combat rolls when fighting in/near MR. You're not conquering the galaxy—you're racing to Mecatol Rex, fortifying it, and holding it while scoring Imperial points repeatedly.

The key strength of Winnu is Mecatol Rex efficiency. Taking MR costs you 0 influence (vs 6 for others), you get free structures on it (PDS + space dock), and your Commander makes you extremely difficult to dislodge (+2 combat = massive advantage). IF you can take and hold MR, you can win. If you can't, you're probably losing.

Opponents will contest Mecatol Rex aggressively once they realize you're racing for it. That moment when you arrive at MR R2 with Blood Ties, take it for free, and immediately place PDS + space dock to fortify? That's your power spike.

## III. The Basics

### A. Home System & Commodities

**Home System:** Winnu (3 resources / 4 influence = 3 optimal resources / 4 optimal influence)

**Commodities:** 3

**Notes:** Balanced home system with 3/4 split. The 4 influence is decent for political plays and removing custodians from other planets (not MR—Blood Ties makes that free). Single-planet home system is easier to defend. Your 3 commodities provide decent trade economy.

### B. Starting Fleet

- 1 Carrier
- 1 Cruiser
- 2 Fighters
- 2 Infantry
- 1 Space Dock
- 1 PDS

**Notes:** Modest starting fleet. Your 1 carrier (capacity 4) + 2 infantry gives you limited R1 expansion capability compared to dual-carrier factions. The cruiser provides speed (move 2) and combat power. The 1 PDS can be used at home for defense or moved forward toward MR.

### C. Starting Technologies

**Choose any 1 technology that has no prerequisites (0 cost techs only)**

**Best Options:**
1. **Sarween Tools (Y)** - Economy boost. Most common choice.
2. **Neural Motivator (G)** - +2 command counters. Excellent for expansion and MR race.
3. **Antimass Deflectors (B)** - Mobility through asteroids, -1 to enemy SPACE CANNON.
4. **Psychoarchaeology (0)** - Action card draw from Politics/Imperial.
5. **Scanlink Drone Network (0)** - Exploration bonuses.

**Recommended:** **Sarween Tools** for economic consistency, OR **Neural Motivator** for R1 expansion + MR race speed.

**Notes:** You start with only 1 tech (weak position). Most factions start with 1-2 techs; you're behind technologically but get complete flexibility in choosing your starting tech.

### D. Faction Abilities

**Blood Ties (Faction Ability):** You do not have to spend influence to remove the custodians token from Mecatol Rex.

Your signature ability. Normally, taking Mecatol Rex costs 6 influence to remove custodians. You spend 0 influence. This is a MASSIVE advantage—you save 6 influence that can be used for voting, Diplomacy plays, or expansion. This makes you the fastest faction to Mecatol Rex (R2 takeover is realistic).

**Reclamation (Faction Ability):** After you resolve a tactical action during which you gained control of Mecatol Rex, you may place 1 PDS and 1 space dock from your reinforcements on Mecatol Rex.

Free structures on Mecatol Rex. After taking MR, immediately place 1 PDS (defensive SPACE CANNON) and 1 space dock (production facility) for free. This instantly fortifies MR—the PDS deters attacks, and the space dock lets you produce defensive fleets directly at MR. Incredible value (saves 4 resources).

### E. Leaders

**Agent - Berekar Berekon:**

When 1 or more of a player's units use PRODUCTION: You may exhaust this card to reduce the combined cost of the produced units by 2.

Economic support agent. When any player (including you or opponents) produces, exhaust this to reduce their production cost by 2 resources. Use on yourself for economic boost or trade to others for favors. Solid political leverage.

**Commander - Rickar Rickani:** *Unlock: Control Mecatol Rex or enter into a combat in the Mecatol Rex system.*

During combat: Apply +2 to the result of each of your unit's combat rolls in the Mecatol Rex system, your home system, and each system that contains a legendary planet.

Your power spike. Easy unlock (just control MR or fight near MR). Once unlocked, you get +2 combat in MR system, your home system, AND legendary planet systems. This makes you EXTREMELY difficult to remove from Mecatol Rex—your infantry hit on 6 instead of 8, your cruisers hit on 5 instead of 7. Massive combat advantage.

**Hero - Mathis Mathinus:** *Unlock: Have 3 scored objectives.* **Imperial Seal** - ACTION: Perform the primary ability of any strategy card. Then, choose any number of other players. Those players may perform the secondary ability of that strategy card. Then, purge this card.

Incredibly flexible hero. Perform ANY strategy card primary at any time, then let other players do the secondary. Use this R4-R5 for critical moments:
- Imperial primary to score 2 points from MR + 1 secret
- Technology primary to research 2 techs
- Leadership primary to gain 3 CCs + ready planets
- Diplomacy primary to ready 2 planets + protect MR

### F. Promissory Note - **Acquiescence**

When the Winnu player resolves a strategic ACTION: You do not have to spend or place a command token to resolve the secondary ability of that strategy card. Then, return this card to the Winnu player.

Useful promissory. Holder can use strategy card secondaries for free (no CC cost). Trade value: 2-3 TG or political favors. Best for factions with CC scarcity (Nomad, Titans).

### G. Alliance

When you produce ships, you may produce 1 additional fighter or infantry for its cost.

Standard production bonus. Useful for economic factions. Trade value: 3-4 TG or equivalent.

### H. Mech - **Reclaimer**

Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | **Sustain Damage**

After you resolve a tactical action during which you gained control of this planet, you may place 1 PDS or 1 space dock from your reinforcements on this planet.

Excellent expansion mech. After conquering a planet, place a free PDS or space dock on it. This accelerates your infrastructure—every conquered planet can immediately become a production facility or defensive position. Very strong for rapid expansion.

### I. Flagship - **Salai Sai Corian**

Cost: 8 | Combat: 7 (x?) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 3 | **Sustain Damage**

When this unit makes a combat roll, it rolls a number of dice equal to the number of your opponent's non-fighter ships in this system.

Scaling flagship. Rolls dice equal to opponent's non-fighter ship count. Against 5 enemy ships, your flagship rolls 5 dice at 7 (hits on 7-10 = 40% each = average 2 hits). Against 10 enemy ships, rolls 10 dice = 4 hits average. Excellent against large fleets, weak against small fleets.

### J. Breakthrough - **Imperator (B<>R)**

Apply +1 to the results of each of your unit's combat rolls for each "Support for the Throne" in your opponent's play area. After you activate a system that contains a legendary planet, apply +1 to the move value of 1 of your ships during this tactical action.

**B<>R Synergy:** Blue and red technologies count as each other for prerequisites.

**Combat Bonus:** For each Support for the Throne your opponent has, your units get +1 combat. If fighting someone with 2 Supports, your units get +2 combat rolls. This stacks with Commander (+2 in MR) for potential +4 combat bonus—absolutely devastating.

**Movement Bonus:** When activating legendary planet systems, +1 move to one ship. Helps reach distant legendary planets.

**B<>R synergy:** Opens flexible tech paths (blue/red interchangeable).

**Note:** The combat bonus scales with how many Supports opponents have. Late game (R4-R5), opponents typically have 1-2 Supports each, giving you +1 to +2 combat universally.

### K. Slice and Draft Considerations

Winnu needs access to Mecatol Rex and resources for fleet production:

**Speaker Order:**
- **Prefer positions 2-4** - Lets you grab Warfare or Politics early for MR race.
- **Last position is acceptable** - Can grab Warfare for MR assault.

**Slice Priorities:**
- **Direct path to Mecatol Rex** - CRITICAL. You MUST be able to reach MR easily R2-R3.
- **Resources for fleet production** - Need 6-8 resources minimum for building fleets to take/hold MR.
- **Tech skips (any helpful)** - You start with 1 tech; any skips accelerate your tech path.
- **Planet count (4-5 planets ideal)** - More planets = more resources for MR race.

**Slice Features to Avoid:**
- **No access to Mecatol Rex** - UNPLAYABLE. If you can't reach MR by R3, you're crippled.
- **Resource-starved slices** - Can't build enough fleets to take/hold MR.
- **Extremely contested MR approaches** - If 2-3 aggressive neighbors all have equal MR access, you'll struggle to secure it.

**Summary:**
Winnu's entire gameplan revolves around Mecatol Rex. You MUST have a clear path to MR, sufficient resources to build fleets, and ideally some defensive positioning to avoid being overwhelmed early. Your slice selection is make-or-break for Winnu.

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

### A. First Turn Priorities

Your R1 priority order: **Expansion > Economy > Tech**

Focus on:
1. **Expansion toward Mecatol Rex** - Every R1 action should position you closer to MR.
2. **Build fleet for MR assault** - Need 5-7 ships by R2 for MR takeover.
3. **Economy** - Trade for commodities, secure resource planets.
4. **Technology** - Fourth priority. Begin tech path if possible.

**Expansion Notes:** You have 1 carrier (capacity 4), 1 cruiser, and 2 infantry. Limited expansion capability (can take 2-3 systems R1 realistically). Prioritize systems on the path to Mecatol Rex—don't expand away from MR.

### B. Mecatol Rex Dependency

Your Commander only unlocks after controlling MR or fighting near it. Your Reclamation only triggers on MR. Your entire faction is built around Mecatol Rex. If you don't take MR by R3, you're playing a severely weakened faction.

**Mitigation:** You MUST take Mecatol Rex R2 or R3. Plan every R1-R2 action toward this goal. This is non-negotiable for Winnu.

### C. Universal Target After Taking MR

Once you control Mecatol Rex, everyone at the table knows:
- You have Commander (+2 combat in MR)
- You have PDS + space dock on MR (Reclamation)
- You'll be scoring Imperial points from MR

You become the primary target. Expect 2-3 players to coordinate attacks on MR.

**Mitigation:** Political deals. "I'll leave MR vulnerable to Player X (creating conflict between opponents)" or "Attack Player Y first, then we can negotiate about MR." Create uncertainty and conflict among opponents.

### D. Weak Early Economy

1 starting tech, 1 space dock, 3/4 home system = you're economically average at best. You're not generating massive resources or influence R1-R2.

**Mitigation:** Take Trade R1 or negotiate favorable trade agreements. Use Agent to reduce production costs. Focus on efficient spending.

## V. Technology

### A. Overview

You start with **one technology of your choice** (0-cost tech only).

Your main tech path should focus on reaching Mecatol Rex quickly (mobility), defending it (PDS/fleet upgrades), and maintaining production (economic techs).

### B. Tech Path 1: MR Rush (Standard)

**Starting Tech:** Sarween Tools (Y) OR Neural Motivator (G)

**Round 1: (Secure starting tech, no R1 research unless critical)**

**Round 2: Gravity Drive (BB) - WITH BLUE SKIP**
- After you activate a system, apply +1 to the move value of 1 of your ships during this tactical action
- **Why:** Reach Mecatol Rex faster. Carrier move 1 → move 2 with Gravity Drive. Critical for R2 MR assault.
- **Prerequisites:** 2 blue (need blue skip OR 2 blue techs)

**Round 3: PDS II (RY)**
- Planetary Shield | SPACE CANNON 5 | Shoots adjacent systems
- **Why:** Fortify Mecatol Rex. With Reclamation's free PDS, upgrading to PDS II makes MR much harder to attack.
- **Prerequisites:** 1 red + 1 yellow

**Round 4: Carrier II (BBBB) OR Fleet Logistics (BB)**
- **Carrier II:** Cost 3 | Combat 9 | Move 2 | Capacity 6
  - **Prerequisites:** 2 blue + Gravity Drive
  - **Why:** Transport armies for MR reinforcement.
- **Fleet Logistics:** Perform 2 actions per turn
  - **Prerequisites:** 2 blue
  - **Why:** Double actions for MR defense + expansion.

**Round 5+:** Flex techs based on objectives

**Tech Requirements:**
- **Blue skip (very helpful):** Accelerates Gravity Drive significantly
- **Yellow skip (helpful):** Speeds Sarween/PDS path
- **Red skip (helpful):** Accelerates PDS II

**Pros:**
- Early Gravity Drive (R2) for fast MR assault
- PDS II R3 for MR defense
- Mobility and defensive focus

**Cons:**
- Delays economic/production techs
- Heavy tech investment early

**Best For:** Most games. Speed to MR is critical—Gravity Drive R2 enables R2 MR takeover.

---

### C. Tech Path 2: Economic Build (Alternative)

**Starting Tech:** Sarween Tools (Y)

**Round 1: Neural Motivator (G)**
- You have +2 starting command counters
- **Why:** More CCs for MR race and expansion.
- **Prerequisites:** 1 green

**Round 2: Lazax Gate Folding (BB)**
- If you don't control Mecatol Rex, treat its system as if it contains alpha and beta wormhole. ACTION: If you control MR, exhaust to place 1 infantry on MR.
- **Why:** Your faction tech. Makes MR system adjacent via wormholes (treat as wormhole system). ACTION to spawn free infantry on MR for defense.
- **Prerequisites:** 2 blue

**Round 3: PDS II (RY)**
- Defend MR with upgraded PDS

**Round 4: Hegemonic Trade Policy (YY)**
- Exhaust when using PRODUCTION; swap resource/influence values of 1 planet until end of turn
- **Why:** Your other faction tech. Flexibility for production or voting.
- **Prerequisites:** 2 yellow

**Round 5+:** Flex

**Pros:**
- Both faction techs (Lazax Gate Folding + Hegemonic Trade Policy)
- Economic flexibility
- Infantry spawn on MR (defensive)

**Cons:**
- Delays Gravity Drive (slower MR assault)
- Faction techs are situational

**Best For:** Games where you can take MR R3 instead of R2. More economic/political focus.

## VI. Strategy Cards

### A. Round One

Your R1 priority is building fleet and moving toward Mecatol Rex.

**R1 Priority Ranking:**

1. **Warfare** - Redistribution + fleet unlock. Excellent for MR assault preparation.

2. **Leadership** - Command counters for expansion and MR race.

3. **Trade** - 3 commodities. Decent economy.

4. **Technology** - If going for fast Gravity Drive.

5. **Politics** - Speaker for agenda control, less critical for MR race.

6. **Construction** - Forward dock toward MR is fine.

7. **Diplomacy** - Protect home while racing to MR.

8. **Imperial** - Never R1.

### B. Generally (R2+)

**Love:**
- **Warfare** - Redistribution after taking MR. Unlock fleets for reinforcement.
- **Imperial** - MANDATORY once you control MR. Score 2 points per Imperial from MR control.
- **Leadership** - CCs for defending MR and expansion.
- **Trade** - Consistent economy from 3 commodities.

**Good:**
- **Politics** - Speaker and agenda control.
- **Technology** - Stay on tech path.
- **Diplomacy** - Protect MR system once you control it.

**Situational:**
- **Construction** - Only if needing structures or forward docks.

## VII. Intermediate

### A. Unit Composition

Your ideal fleet composition for taking/holding Mecatol Rex:

**Taking MR (R2-R3):**
- **6-8 ships total** (mix of cruisers, carriers, destroyers)
- **4-6 infantry** (for ground invasion)
- **1 PDS** (can bring starting PDS if needed)

**Holding MR (R3-R5):**
- **PDS II on MR** (via Reclamation + upgrade)
- **Space dock on MR** (via Reclamation)
- **8-10 ships in MR system** (carriers, cruisers, destroyers)
- **6-8 ground forces on MR** (infantry + mechs)
- **Flagship (optional)** - Scales with enemy fleet size

With Commander (+2 combat in MR), your defenders are extremely powerful. Infantry hit on 6 instead of 8, cruisers hit on 5 instead of 7. This makes you very difficult to dislodge.

### B. Point Planning

**Winnu Christmas-Land Strategy Cards:**

| Round | Card             | Public Points | Secret Points | MR Points | Bonus | Total |
|-------|------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------|-------|-------|
| One   | Warfare          | 0             | 0             | 0         | 0     | 0     |
| Two   | Leadership       | 1             | 0             | 0         | 0     | 1     |
| Three | Imperial         | 3             | 1             | 2         | 0     | 6     |
| Four  | Politics         | 4             | 2             | 2         | 1     | 9     |
| Five  | Imperial         | 6             | 3             | 4         | 1     | 14    |

You can only score 1 public objective per round (2 if you have Imperial). When you take Imperial, you can double score publics. Aim to score all 3 secrets across the game.

**Notes:**
- Winnu's point path is MR-dependent. R3 Imperial scores 2 MR points + public + secret = 4 points
- R5 Imperial scores 2 MR points + public + secret = 4 more points
- Total from MR: 4 MR points + 2 bonus public points from Imperial = 6 points from MR alone
- Hero R4 can be used for critical strategy card (Imperial, Technology, Leadership)

### C. Game Plan

**Strategic Approach:**

**Rounds 1-2: Race to Mecatol Rex**
- Take Warfare or Leadership R1
- Expand toward MR with 3-4 systems
- Build fleet (6-8 ships by R2)
- Research Gravity Drive R2 (if possible)
- Take Mecatol Rex R2 using Blood Ties (0 influence cost)
- Reclamation: Place free PDS + space dock on MR
- Commander unlocks!

**Rounds 3-4: Hold MR & Score Imperial**
- Take Imperial R3 (score 2 points from MR + public + secret)
- Research PDS II R3 (fortify MR with SPACE CANNON 5)
- Produce defensive fleet at MR space dock
- Make political deals to deter attacks
- Use Agent to reduce production costs (help yourself or trade to others)
- Hero R4 for critical strategy card (Imperial again, Technology for 2 techs, or Leadership for 3 CCs)

**Round 5: Final Push & Victory**
- Take Imperial R5 (score 2 more points from MR)
- Commander (+2 combat) makes MR nearly unkillable
- Produce reinforcements at MR space dock
- Win via MR control (6 points total from MR) + objectives

**Key Strategic Principles:**
1. **Take Mecatol Rex R2** - Non-negotiable. Every R1 action should prepare for this.
2. **Defend MR ruthlessly** - PDS II + space dock + Commander (+2 combat) = fortress
3. **Score Imperial 2-3 times** - 2 points per Imperial from MR = 4-6 points total
4. **Use Hero R4-R5** - Perform any strategy card primary at critical moment
5. **Political deals** - "Attack Player X instead of me" or "Let me keep MR, I'll support you"
6. **Commander advantage** - +2 combat in MR makes you extremely difficult to remove

## IX. Alliance Priority

Trading for other factions' Alliance promissory notes (which give you access to their Commanders) can significantly boost your strategy. Here are the top alliances to prioritize:

**Super Top Tier:**
1. **Nomad (Navarch Feng)** - Produce flagship without spending resources. Saves 8 resources for MR fleet production.
2. **Titans of Ul (Tungstantus)** - When you use PRODUCTION, gain 1 trade good. You produce constantly at MR space dock = constant TG income.
3. **Hacan (Carth of Golden Sands)** - After you roll dice for combat/SPACE CANNON/AFB, reroll any number. Boosts your Commander combat rolls.
4. **Jol-Nar (Ta Zern)** - When units use PRODUCTION/AFB/BOMBARDMENT/SPACE CANNON, reroll any dice. Boosts PDS and production.

**Really Useful:**
5. **Sardakk N'orr (G'hom Sek'kus)** - During Commit Ground Forces, commit 1 ground force from each planet in active/adjacent systems. Helps MR invasions.
6. **Muaat (Magmus)** - After you spend strategy token, gain 1 trade good. CC usage = TG income.
7. **Empyrean (Xuange)** - After player moves ships into system with your tokens, return token. Useful for MR defense.
8. **L1Z1X (Il Na Viroset)** - During tactical actions, activate systems with your tokens and return both tokens. Flexibility for MR defense.

## X. End Notes

Winnu is one of the weakest factions in TI4, but with perfect execution and favorable board state, they can win by controlling Mecatol Rex R2-R5. Your job is to:

1. **Take Mecatol Rex R2** - Use Blood Ties (0 influence cost) to remove custodians for free
2. **Fortify MR with Reclamation** - Place free PDS + space dock on MR immediately
3. **Unlock Commander R2** - Get +2 combat in MR system, making you nearly unkillable there
4. **Research PDS II R3** - Upgrade MR's PDS for SPACE CANNON 5 defensive coverage
5. **Score Imperial 2-3 times** - Take Imperial R3 and R5, score 2 points per Imperial from MR
6. **Use Hero R4-R5** - Perform any strategy card primary at critical moment (Imperial, Technology, Leadership)
7. **Defend MR ruthlessly** - Commander (+2 combat) + PDS II + space dock + fleet = fortress

You're not favored to win, but:
- Blood Ties saves 6 influence (massive advantage for MR race)
- Reclamation gives free PDS + space dock on MR (instant fortification)
- Commander (+2 combat in MR) makes you extremely difficult to remove
- Hero flexibility can swing critical moments
- Imperator breakthrough scales with opponent Supports (+1 per Support)

Play patiently, secure Mecatol Rex early, defend it ruthlessly, score Imperial repeatedly, and you can overcome your weaknesses through MR dominance.

**THE THRONE IS OURS.**
