<h2 id="i.-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>The Winnu are TI4’s Mecatol Rex specialists—a faction with exactly
one strategy: take Mecatol Rex early and hold it. Their quirky, all-in
nature makes them a fan favorite to love (or hate). You’re racing to MR,
fortifying it with free structures, and defending the throne with
everything you’ve got.</p>
<p>This faction has surprising power when piloted correctly. Despite
appearing weak on paper, their MR bonuses can snowball into victory if
you execute the rush perfectly and survive the inevitable backlash.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-playstyle">II. Playstyle</h2>
<p>Playing Winnu is like being the rightful heir to an empty throne. You
start weak—limited tech, modest fleet—but you overcome it by claiming
what’s rightfully yours. You take Mecatol Rex for free while others pay
dearly, fortify it instantly, and become a defensive powerhouse when
fighting for key targets like Mecatol Rex and legendaries. You’re not
conquering the galaxy—you’re claiming the throne and daring anyone to
take it from you.</p>
<p>Expect massive swing turns—dominating one round, then getting ganged
up on the next. Once you take Mecatol Rex, you become everyone’s
problem. It’s king of the hill, and you’re standing on top with every
other player trying to knock you off.</p>
<p>If you secure and hold Mecatol Rex, you win. If you can’t, you lose.
It’s that simple.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iii.-the-basics">III. The Basics</h2>
<h3 id="a.-home-system-commodities">A. Home System &amp;
Commodities</h3>
<p><strong>Home System:</strong> - <strong>Winnu:</strong> 3 resources /
4 influence - <strong>Total: 3 resources / 4 influence (0 optimal
resources / 4 optimal influence)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commodities:</strong> 3</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> You need resources to improve your dire
plastic situation early game, but you only have a 4 influence home
system which you often have to spend as early resources. This creates
early economic tension. However, single-planet home with starting PDS +
Commander (unlocked after taking MR) creates crazy strong defense
later.</p>
<h3 id="b.-starting-fleet">B. Starting Fleet</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 Carrier</li>
<li>1 Cruiser</li>
<li>2 Fighters</li>
<li>2 Infantry</li>
<li>1 Space Dock</li>
<li>1 PDS</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Very modest fleet. Low ship count, poor
infantry (only 2), and only 1 capacity ship is terrible for expansion.
Your Round 1 expansion is a key feature for your success—sell your soul
to get plastic on the board. Trade aggressively, use Construction, do
whatever it takes to expand to 3+ systems and build more units
early.</p>
<h3 id="c.-faction-abilities">C. Faction Abilities</h3>
<p><strong>Blood Ties (Faction Ability):</strong> You do not have to
spend influence to remove the custodians token from Mecatol Rex.</p>
<p>Your signature ability. Normally, taking Mecatol Rex costs 6
influence to remove custodians. You spend 0 influence. This makes you
the strongest custodian faction. Problem is, this puts a bullseye on you
so very clearly—everyone knows you’re going for MR. At the same time,
gotta risk it for the biscuit.</p>
<p><strong>Reclamation (Faction Ability):</strong> After you resolve a
tactical action during which you gained control of Mecatol Rex, you may
place 1 PDS and 1 space dock from your reinforcements on Mecatol
Rex.</p>
<p>Free structures on Mecatol Rex. Instant fortification. Once you take
it, you should try to hold it—you have bonus combat power and structures
to help. Easiest way to hold it is with mechs and infantry. Very hard to
hold the space.</p>
<h3 id="d.-starting-and-faction-technologies">D. Starting and Faction
Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Technologies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Choose any 1 technology that has no prerequisites (0 cost
techs only)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Best Options:</strong> 1. <strong>Dark Energy Tap</strong> -
For value and action-heavy playstyle. 2. <strong>AI Development
Algorithm</strong> - For defensive and slow roll playstyle.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Being able to pick any tech is flexible, but
not all techs are made equal. These 2 offer differing playstyles—DET for
more value and actions, AI DEV for more defensive and slow rolling your
way to victory.</p>
<p><strong>Faction Technologies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lazax Gate Folding (BB):</strong> <em>During your tactical
actions, if you do not control Mecatol Rex, treat its system as if it
contains both an alpha and beta wormhole. ACTION: If you control Mecatol
Rex, exhaust this card to place 1 infantry from your reinforcements on
Mecatol Rex.</em></p>
<p>Very situational. Only useful in weird slices where it’s problematic
to get to MR but happens to have a well-placed wormhole. Very niche.</p>
<p><strong>Hegemonic Trade Policy (YY):</strong> <em>Exhaust this card
when 1 or more of your units use PRODUCTION; swap the resource and
influence values of 1 planet you control until the end of your
turn.</em></p>
<p>Really weird tech that seems incredibly niche. When would you need
this? If you want flexibility, just use your trade goods—they’re already
flexible. This does nothing for you and is costly on a bad tech
path.</p>
<h3 id="e.-leaders">E. Leaders</h3>
<p><strong>Agent - Berekar Berekon:</strong></p>
<p>When 1 or more of a player’s units use PRODUCTION: You may exhaust
this card to reduce the combined cost of the produced units by 2.</p>
<p>Big solve for your early production and defense, but 2 resources only
for production is not overly useful. Good to have any economy, but agent
is on the weaker side. Rarely sold.</p>
<p><strong>Commander - Rickar Rickani:</strong> <em>Unlock: Control
Mecatol Rex or enter into a combat in the Mecatol Rex system.</em></p>
<p>During combat: Apply +2 to the result of each of your unit’s combat
rolls in the Mecatol Rex system, your home system, and each system that
contains a legendary planet.</p>
<p>Easy unlock. Combat powerhouse for defending Mecatol Rex, your home,
and legendaries. Great if you have a lot of legendary planets. Activates
before you fight on Mecatol if you didn’t get there first. Key aspect of
your game.</p>
<p><strong>Hero - Mathis Mathinus:</strong> <em>Unlock: Have 3 scored
objectives.</em> <strong>Imperial Seal</strong> - ACTION: Perform the
primary ability of any strategy card. Then, choose any number of other
players. Those players may perform the secondary ability of that
strategy card. Then, purge this card.</p>
<p>Almost always used for Imperial to make a big point swing, especially
assuming you’ll often be behind or trying to make a big rush for the
finish if people didn’t put you down early.</p>
<h3 id="f.-promissory-note---acquiescence">F. Promissory Note -
<strong>Acquiescence</strong></h3>
<p>When the Winnu player resolves a strategic ACTION: You do not have to
spend or place a command token to resolve the secondary ability of that
strategy card. Then, return this card to the Winnu player.</p>
<p>Useful promissory. Try to sell for 2 TG every round. Does affect
Leadership a bit (since they spend no token), so effectively giving you
-2 TG.</p>
<h3 id="g.-alliance">G. Alliance</h3>
<p>Whoever holds your alliance card has your Commander (Rickar Rickani -
+2 combat in Mecatol Rex, home system, and legendary planet
systems).</p>
<p>Very valuable. If you already have control of MR, you can consider
selling since the person attacking you will lose it before getting bonus
value. Before that, never risk someone having your big bonus on MR.</p>
<h3 id="h.-mech---reclaimer">H. Mech - <strong>Reclaimer</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | <strong>Sustain Damage</strong></p>
<p>After you resolve a tactical action during which you gained control
of this planet, you may place 1 PDS or 1 space dock from your
reinforcements on this planet.</p>
<p>Excellent expansion mech. After conquering a planet, place a free PDS
or space dock on it. This accelerates your infrastructure—every
conquered planet can immediately become a production facility or
defensive position. Very strong for slow expansion.</p>
<p>Try to make a few early mechs (2 minimum), then use them to walk
towards Mecatol for a very safe and structure-filled slice.</p>
<p><strong>Special Note:</strong> Hope’s End attachment can give you
early mechs, which is huge for Winnu.</p>
<h3 id="i.-flagship---salai-sai-corian">I. Flagship - <strong>Salai Sai
Corian</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 8 | Combat: 7 (x?) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 3 | <strong>Sustain
Damage</strong></p>
<p>When this unit makes a combat roll, it rolls a number of dice equal
to the number of your opponent’s non-fighter ships in this system.</p>
<p>One of the best flagships in the game. Always get it. Rolls dice
equal to opponent’s non-fighter ship count. If put on Mecatol with
Commander, it hits on 5 (7 - 2 = 5). Excellent against large fleets.</p>
<h3 id="j.-breakthrough---imperator-br">J. Breakthrough -
<strong>Imperator (B&lt;&gt;R)</strong></h3>
<p>Apply +1 to the results of each of your unit’s combat rolls for each
“Support for the Throne” in your opponent’s play area. After you
activate a system that contains a legendary planet, apply +1 to the move
value of 1 of your ships during this tactical action.</p>
<p><strong>B&lt;&gt;R Synergy:</strong> Blue and red technologies count
as each other for prerequisites.</p>
<p>If planning to get custodian, very helpful to get this instead of
tech. Functions as Gravity Drive for legendary planets. Combat bonus for
each Support for the Throne opponents have.</p>
<h3 id="k.-slice-and-draft-considerations">K. Slice and Draft
Considerations</h3>
<p>Winnu needs access to Mecatol Rex and resources for fleet
production:</p>
<p><strong>Speaker Order:</strong> Loves speaker. Trade is your very
best tool—makes a huge difference. Otherwise, any early value is
helpful, so try to be early.</p>
<p><strong>Slice Priorities:</strong> - <strong>Clear path to Mecatol
Rex</strong> - Critical for your MR rush. - <strong>Resource-heavy
planets</strong> - You need resources for fleet production. -
<strong>Legendary planets</strong> - Synergize with Commander combat
bonus. - <strong>Rich slice</strong> - You’re quite poor, so a rich
slice is good. - <strong>Hope’s End</strong> - Gives you early mechs,
which is huge.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid:</strong> - <strong>Asteroid fields on the way to
Mecatol</strong> - Slows you down. - <strong>Gravity rift on the way to
Mecatol</strong> - Dangerous and costly. - <strong>Entropic
Scar</strong> - Not good for you. Let someone else get it. Both your
faction techs are niche.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iv.-structural-weaknesses">IV. Structural Weaknesses</h2>
<h3 id="a.-first-turn-priorities">A. First Turn Priorities</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1 Priority Rankings:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Expansion + Production</strong> - Most important. Solving
early production with Construction or Warfare might be necessary. You
have to spread out in some way. Build fleet and claim systems toward
MR.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Breakthrough</strong> - Get Imperator if possible. Tech
is more costly in general.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology</strong> - Lower priority than
breakthrough.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scoring</strong> - Scoring early with Winnu is almost
impossible and I would highly refrain from it. Your start is so weak you
need others to spend resources and effort to score while you get back up
to even.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Expansion Notes:</strong> You have 1 carrier (capacity 4), 1
cruiser, and 2 infantry. 2 systems is realistic. If you have a handy
legendary planet in a good spot, you might be able to get 3.</p>
<h3 id="b.-mecatol-rex-dependency">B. Mecatol Rex Dependency</h3>
<p>All your abilities point toward Mecatol. Your Commander only unlocks
after controlling MR or fighting near it. Your Reclamation only triggers
on MR. Your entire faction is built around Mecatol Rex.</p>
<p>If you play with people/factions that also like Mecatol, it will be a
tough battle. Small note: with the new fracture, less people might be in
the way of your Mecatol control.</p>
<h3 id="c.-universal-target">C. Universal Target</h3>
<p>People know that if you get rolling, it’s surprisingly hard to stop
you. You can have massive swingy turns with Imperial x2. They might
screw you early or team up later to take you down.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="v.-technology">V. Technology</h2>
<h3 id="a.-overview">A. Overview</h3>
<p>You start with <strong>one technology of your choice</strong> (0-cost
tech only). <strong>Dark Energy Tap</strong> or <strong>AI Development
Algorithm</strong> are the best choices.</p>
<p>Your starting tech determines your path: fast blue path or slow red
path. Fast blue path gets you mobile early with Gravity Drive. Slow red
path focuses on defensive tech and unit upgrades.</p>
<h3 id="b.-tech-path-1-blue-path-fast">B. Tech Path 1: Blue Path
(Fast)</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Tech:</strong> Dark Energy Tap</p>
<p><strong>Round 1:</strong> Gravity Drive (B) - if you can afford tech
- After you activate a system, apply +1 to the move value of 1 of your
ships - <strong>Why:</strong> Reach Mecatol faster. Critical for early
MR assault.</p>
<p><strong>Round 2:</strong> Carrier II (BB) - Cost 3, Combat 9, Move 2,
Capacity 6 - <strong>Why:</strong> Better transport for armies and
reinforcements to MR.</p>
<p><strong>Round 3:</strong> Sling Relay (B) OR Fleet Logistics (BB) -
<strong>Sling Relay:</strong> ACTION: Exhaust to produce 1 ship in any
system with your space docks - <strong>Fleet Logistics:</strong> Perform
2 actions per turn - <strong>Why:</strong> Production flexibility or
double actions for positioning.</p>
<p><strong>Round 4:</strong> Fleet Logistics (BB) OR Light/Wave
Deflector (BBB) - <strong>Light/Wave Deflector:</strong> Your ships can
move through systems that contain other players’ ships -
<strong>Why:</strong> Bypass blockades, extreme mobility.</p>
<p><strong>Round 5+:</strong> Flex techs</p>
<p>Together with your breakthrough, this path offers great mobility to
make some moves.</p>
<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Flexibility and movement objectives.
Slightly weaker defensively. Good in general.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="c.-tech-path-2-red-path-slow">C. Tech Path 2: Red Path
(Slow)</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Tech:</strong> AI Development Algorithm</p>
<p><strong>Round 1:</strong> Gravity Drive (B) - if you can afford tech
- After you activate a system, apply +1 to the move value of 1 of your
ships - <strong>Why:</strong> Mobility for reaching targets.</p>
<p><strong>Round 2:</strong> Magen Defense Grid (R) - When any player
activates a system with your structures, place 1 infantry with each
structure. At start of ground combat on planet with your structures,
produce 1 hit - <strong>Why:</strong> Free infantry when systems
activated, plus ground combat hit. Strong defensive tech.</p>
<p><strong>Round 3:</strong> PDS II (RY) - Planetary Shield, SPACE
CANNON 5. Can shoot ships adjacent to this unit’s system -
<strong>Why:</strong> Upgrade your PDS network. Strong defense.</p>
<p><strong>Round 4:</strong> Destroyer II (RR) - Cost 1, Combat 8, Move
2, ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE 6 (x3) - <strong>Why:</strong> Cheap upgraded
destroyers with AFB.</p>
<p><strong>Round 5:</strong> Carrier II (BB) - Cost 3, Combat 9, Move 2,
Capacity 6 - <strong>Why:</strong> Better transport capacity.</p>
<p>More unit focused. Tons of PDS defending your slice. Best utilized if
you have multiple mechs walking out in your slice over 2 turns to fill
out with structures.</p>
<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Defensive play and combat objectives.
Weaker mobility. Good if you want more structures and ground forces.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vi.-strategy-cards">VI. Strategy Cards</h2>
<h3 id="a.-round-1">A. Round 1</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1 Priority Ranking:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Trade</strong> - Very best card. Get resources to not be
seen as a target.</li>
<li><strong>Technology</strong> - Useful to save resources. Early tech
is useful to get the best systems in slice.</li>
<li><strong>Politics</strong> - For setting up custodian and MR Round 2,
but can be resource starved.</li>
<li><strong>Construction</strong> - If you need to produce (risk of no
Warfare).</li>
<li><strong>Leadership</strong> - Just for breakthrough and bonus tokens
can give some bonuses early.</li>
<li><strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Resources and unlock breakthrough.
Taking your slice without mechs is sad.</li>
<li><strong>Warfare</strong> - If someone took Construction.</li>
<li><strong>Imperial</strong> - Never Round 1.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Strategy Token Priority:</strong> Warfare and Diplomacy as
strategy tokens.</p>
<h3 id="b.-round-2">B. Round 2+</h3>
<p><strong>Love:</strong> - <strong>Imperial</strong> - Score points
from Mecatol Rex control. Your win condition. - <strong>Trade</strong> -
Make more plastic and not appear like an easy target. Always good to
make friends and have a flexible economy.</p>
<p><strong>Good:</strong> - <strong>Leadership</strong> - Command tokens
for actions and defense. - <strong>Politics</strong> - To be able to
secure Imperial.</p>
<p><strong>Situational:</strong> - <strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Bonus
economy or protecting a key system. - <strong>Construction</strong> -
Almost useless if you took your slice properly and got structures from
mech and MR. - <strong>Warfare</strong> - Redistribution or fleet unlock
if necessary.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vii.-intermediate">VII. Intermediate</h2>
<h3 id="a.-unit-composition">A. Unit Composition</h3>
<p><strong>Blue Path Composition:</strong> - <strong>Carriers</strong> -
Your main transport. Upgrade to Carrier II (BB) for move 2 and capacity
6. Essential for moving armies to Mecatol and reinforcing it. -
<strong>Infantry</strong> - Your ground forces. With Commander (+2
combat), they hit on 6 instead of 8 on Mecatol. Cheap and effective
defenders. - <strong>Mechs</strong> - Sustain Damage ground forces. Use
Reclaimer ability to place free structures when conquering planets.
Critical for building your infrastructure. - <strong>Flagship</strong> -
Rolls dice equal to opponent’s non-fighter ships. With Commander, hits
on 5 instead of 7 on Mecatol. Devastating against large fleets. -
<strong>Fighter screen</strong> - Cheap fleet support. Absorb hits and
provide fleet presence.</p>
<p><strong>Red Path Composition:</strong> - <strong>Carriers</strong> -
Transport for infantry and mechs. Upgrade to Carrier II (BB) for move 2
and capacity 6. - <strong>Destroyers</strong> - Cheap ships with AFB.
Upgrade to Destroyer II (RR) for combat 8 and AFB 6 (x3). More
cost-effective than cruisers or dreadnoughts. -
<strong>Infantry</strong> - Your ground forces. With Commander (+2
combat), hit on 6 on Mecatol. Essential for holding the planet. -
<strong>Mechs</strong> - Sustain Damage ground forces. Reclaimer ability
places free structures. Build 2-4 mechs early and walk them toward
Mecatol. - <strong>Flagship</strong> - Scales with opponent’s fleet
size. Hits on 5 with Commander on Mecatol. Excellent defensive ship. -
<strong>Fighter screen</strong> - Cheap units for fleet presence and
absorbing hits.</p>
<p><strong>General Note:</strong> Try to avoid expensive ships like
dreadnoughts. With Commander combat bonus, cheaper units become very
effective.</p>
<h3 id="b.-game-plan">B. Game Plan</h3>
<p><strong>Early Game (Round 1):</strong></p>
<p>Your early game is about surviving your weak start and positioning
for Mecatol Rex. Expand to 2-3 systems, prioritize Trade for economy,
and build plastic to not look like an easy target. If you can afford
tech Round 1, grab Gravity Drive for mobility. Build mechs early (2
minimum) and walk them toward Mecatol to create a structure-filled
path.</p>
<p><strong>Round 2 - Custodian Grab:</strong></p>
<p>Take custodians on Mecatol Rex using Blood Ties (free 6 influence
cost removal). This is your optimal play—you’re the best custodian
faction and should leverage it. Place free PDS and space dock with
Reclamation immediately. Your Commander unlocks, giving you +2 combat in
the MR system, making you nearly unkillable there. Politics Round 1
helps set this up. Start building your defensive fleet on MR to prepare
for inevitable attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Mid Game (Rounds 3-4):</strong></p>
<p>If you secured custodians Round 2, focus on holding Mecatol Rex and
scoring Imperial points. Take Imperial when possible to score 2 points
from MR control. Make political deals to avoid getting ganged up
on—you’re now everyone’s problem.</p>
<p>If you didn’t get custodians Round 2, take Mecatol Rex now using
Blood Ties. By this point, your slice should be carefully defended with
mechs and structures, allowing you to make greedy moves toward MR
without exposing your home system. Place free PDS and space dock with
Reclamation. Your Commander unlocks, giving you combat power on Mecatol
and legendaries.</p>
<p><strong>Late Game (Round 5+):</strong></p>
<p>Hold Mecatol Rex and keep scoring Imperial. Your Commander makes you
surprisingly hard to dislodge. Use your Hero for a massive point swing
when needed. Win through MR control and Imperial scoring.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="viii.-objectives">VIII. Objectives</h2>
<h3 id="a.-objective-summary">A. Objective Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Excels at MR objectives with Blood Ties
and natural positioning on Mecatol Rex. Reclamation provides free
structures for structure objectives, and Commander helps defend key
positions.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Poor early expansion and weak economy
(3/4 home) make planet control and spending objectives challenging. Tech
objectives are difficult with 1 starting tech, and losing MR removes
most advantages.</p>

<h2 id="ix.-alliance-priority">IX. Alliance Priority</h2>
<p>Alliance preference ranking based on commander utility:</p>
<p><strong>Top Tier:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Nomad</strong> (Navarch Feng) - Produce flagship without
spending resources. Saves 8 resources for MR fleet.</li>
<li><strong>Deepwrought</strong> (Aello) - Gain commodity/TG when others
research tech. Passive income you desperately need.</li>
<li><strong>Crimson Rebellion</strong> (Ahk Siever) - Gain 1 TG after
any combat (all players’ fights). Constant passive income.</li>
<li><strong>Empyrean</strong> (Xuange) - Return tokens when others move
into your systems. Critical for coordinating MR retakes.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Good:</strong></p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><strong>Muaat</strong> (Magmus) - Gain 1 TG after spending strategy
pool token. Passive income boost.</li>
<li><strong>Titans of Ul</strong> (Tungstantus) - Gain 1 TG when using
production. Income at MR space dock.</li>
<li><strong>Jol-Nar</strong> (Ta Zern) - Reroll unit ability dice
(BOMBARDMENT, AFB, SPACE CANNON). Insane with Magen/PDS defense.</li>
<li><strong>Argent Flight</strong> (Trrakan Aun Zulok) - Roll 1
additional die for unit abilities. Insane with Magen/PDS defense.</li>
<li><strong>Vuil’raith</strong> (That Which Molds Flesh) - 2
fighters/infantry don’t count against production. More plastic.</li>
<li><strong>Yssaril</strong> (So Ata) - Look at cards when activating
systems with your units. Intel for MR defense planning.</li>

<p>Winnu is TI4’s ultimate king-of-the-hill faction—weak on paper,
terrifying when executed correctly. You’re playing an all-or-nothing
game: claim the throne early and hold it, or lose trying.</p>
<p><strong>The Winnu Experience:</strong> Your early game is fragile.
Poor starting fleet, terrible economy, limited expansion. You’re racing
to Mecatol Rex Round 2 while everyone knows it’s coming. Blood Ties lets
you take custodians for free (saving 6 influence), Reclamation gives you
instant fortification with free structures, and your Commander makes you
nearly unkillable on MR with +2 combat.</p>
<p><strong>The Challenges:</strong> You’re everyone’s problem the moment
you take Mecatol. Expect massive backlash, constant threats, and
political maneuvering. You need to make deals, spread favors, and
convince the table that someone else is the real threat. Your Mecatol
dependency means losing it can end your game. You live and die by that
throne.</p>
<p><strong>What Makes It Fun:</strong> Massive swing turns. Holding
Mecatol against overwhelming odds. Free custodian removal when everyone
else pays dearly. Scoring Imperial multiple times while daring anyone to
take it from you. Your Hero can copy any strategy card primary at a
critical moment—perfect for clutch plays. When you’re defending that
throne with Commander (+2), PDS, structures, and your fleet, you feel
invincible.</p>
<p>Play aggressively, claim what’s yours, defend ruthlessly, and prove
the rightful heirs can reclaim their throne.</p>
<p><strong>Your Emperor commands you to take your fleet to Mecatol
Rex.</strong></p>
