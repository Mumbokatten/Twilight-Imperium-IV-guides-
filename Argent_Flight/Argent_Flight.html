<h2 id="i.-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>Argent Flight is one of the most explosive combat factions in TI4.
This faction excels at obliterating fighter screens with devastating
ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE, spamming cheap destroyers for early aggression,
and blasting enemies with PDS networks. Argent Flight isn’t subtle—it’s
about destroying your opponents’ fleets efficiently and controlling
space through superior firepower.</p>
<p>The payoff? Watching opponents realize their fighters are target
practice for your Raid Formation, seeing capital ships get shredded by
excess AFB hits, and denying entire systems with PDS coverage. When your
destroyers arrive, space combat becomes a massacre.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-playstyle">II. Playstyle</h2>
<p>Playing Argent Flight is like commanding a swarm of angry space
hornets with laser turrets. Your cheap Strike Wing Alpha destroyers
swarm the map early, your ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE shreds through fighter
screens AND damages capital ships via Raid Formation, and your PDS
networks deny movement and blast approaching fleets before combat even
starts.</p>
<p>The key strength of Argent Flight is cost-efficient destruction. Spam
cheap destroyers with brutal AFB, leverage your Commander for extra dice
on unit abilities (AFB, SPACE CANNON, BOMBARDMENT), and force opponents
to either avoid you or bring expensive capital ships. You win through
volume of fire and efficiency.</p>
<p>Opponents will respect your firepower early. That moment when your 2
destroyers delete an entire fighter screen and damage a dreadnought with
excess AFB hits? Utterly satisfying.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iii.-the-basics">III. The Basics</h2>
<h3 id="a.-home-system-commodities">A. Home System &amp;
Commodities</h3>
<p><strong>Home System:</strong> - <strong>Ylir:</strong> 0 resources /
2 influence = 2 optimal influence - <strong>Valk:</strong> 2 resources /
0 influence = 2 optimal resources - <strong>Avar:</strong> 1 resource /
1 influence = 0.5 optimal resources + 0.5 optimal influence -
<strong>Total: 3 resources / 3 influence (2.5 optimal resources / 2.5
optimal influence)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commodities:</strong> 3</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Three planets in your home system is
fantastic for early expansion and objectives. The optimal count
(2.5/2.5) means you have flexibility—Avar’s balanced 1/1 can be spent as
either resources or influence depending on what you need.</p>
<p><strong>Defense Issue:</strong> 3-planet home systems are harder to
defend late game—you need to spread ground forces across 3 planets
instead of 1-2, making it easier for opponents to invade. You’ll need to
rely on PDS networks and Aerie Hololattice (blocks movement through
systems with your structures) to keep your home system safe.</p>
<h3 id="b.-starting-fleet">B. Starting Fleet</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 Carrier</li>
<li>2 Destroyers (Strike Wing Alpha I)</li>
<li>2 Fighters</li>
<li>5 Infantry</li>
<li>1 Space Dock</li>
<li>1 PDS</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> One of the best starting fleets in the game.
Your 2 destroyers each have capacity 1, and you have 5 infantry—this
lets you send each destroyer 2 systems away from your home system to
claim planets independently. You can take 2 systems that are 2-move away
on R1, giving you incredible expansion reach. This makes it nearly
impossible to find an unplayable slice for Argent—you can reach almost
any planet configuration.</p>
<h3 id="c.-starting-technologies">C. Starting Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Choose TWO of the following:</strong> - <strong>Neural
Motivator (Green)</strong> - Provides green prerequisite -
<strong>Sarween Tools (Yellow)</strong> - Reduces production costs by 1
resource - <strong>Plasma Scoring (Red)</strong> - Provides red
prerequisite and combat boost</p>
<p><strong>Recommended:</strong> <strong>Sarween Tools + Plasma
Scoring</strong> - This is the only reasonable choice. Gives you
flexibility and enables easy expansion. Sarween provides economy and
leads to Aerie Hololattice (Y) if going structure path. Plasma Scoring
leads to Strike Wing Alpha II (RR). Neural Motivator is bait—green
doesn’t lead to any techs Argent actually wants.</p>
<h3 id="d.-faction-abilities">D. Faction Abilities</h3>
<p><strong>Zeal (Faction Ability):</strong> You always vote first during
the agenda phase. When you cast at least 1 vote, cast 1 additional vote
for each player in the game, including you.</p>
<p>Strong voting power with a downside. In a 6-player game, casting 1
vote becomes 7 votes total (1 + 6 bonus). However, voting first means
you commit your votes before seeing what others do—you can’t kingmake or
react. You’re forced to vote your interest, then others decide if they
want to pile on or counter you. Trade your votes for favors when you
don’t care about the outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Raid Formation (Faction Ability):</strong> When 1 or more of
your units use ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE, for each hit produced in excess of
your opponent’s fighters, choose 1 of your opponent’s ships that has
Sustain Damage to become damaged.</p>
<p>This makes your ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE terrifying. After destroying all
fighters, excess hits go straight to capital ships with Sustain Damage.
Fighter screens become a liability against you.</p>
<p><strong>Strike Wing Alpha I (Destroyer):</strong> Cost: 1 | Combat: 8
| Move: 2 | Capacity: 1 | ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE 9 (x2)</p>
<p>Your bread and butter. Cheap destroyers with AFB and capacity for
transporting infantry. Mass produce these early game.</p>
<h3 id="e.-leaders">E. Leaders</h3>
<p><strong>Agent - Trilossa Aun Mirik:</strong> When a player produces
ground forces in a system: You may exhaust this card; that player may
place those units on any planets they control in that system and any
adjacent systems.</p>
<p>Useful for helping players with flexible ground force placement.
Trade incentive or favor generator.</p>
<p><strong>Commander - Trrakan Aun Zulok:</strong> <em>Unlock: Have 6
units that have ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE, SPACE CANNON, or BOMBARDMENT on
the game board.</em></p>
<p>When 1 or more of your units make a roll for a unit ability: You may
choose 1 of those units to roll 1 additional die.</p>
<p>Easy to unlock with destroyers and PDS. Significantly boosts your
ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE, SPACE CANNON, and BOMBARDMENT effectiveness. Aim
to unlock R2-R3.</p>
<p><strong>Hero - Mirik Aun Sissiri:</strong> <em>Unlock: Have 3 scored
objectives.</em> <strong>Helix Protocol</strong> - ACTION: Move any
number of your ships from any systems to any number of other systems
that contain 1 of your command tokens and no other players’ ships. Then,
purge this card.</p>
<p>Massive repositioning tool. Use for surprise attacks, defensive
regrouping, or scoring movement objectives. Save for a critical
moment—usually R4-R5 when positioning matters most for victory.</p>
<h3 id="f.-promissory-note---strike-wing-ambuscade">F. Promissory Note -
<strong>Strike Wing Ambuscade</strong></h3>
<p>When 1 or more of your units make a roll for a unit ability: Choose 1
of those units to roll 1 additional die. Then, return this card to the
Argent player.</p>
<p>Useful for ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE, SPACE CANNON, or BOMBARDMENT users.
Trade value: Max 1 TG. Sell this at every possible opportunity—trade it
to the active player during their turn so it gets used and returned to
you, rather than sitting unused in someone’s hand.</p>
<h3 id="g.-alliance">G. Alliance</h3>
<p><strong>Alliance Ability:</strong> <em>While the Argent Flight
player’s commander is unlocked:</em> <em>When 1 or more of your units
make a roll for a unit ability, you may choose 1 of those units to roll
1 additional die.</em></p>
<p>Excellent alliance for factions with ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE, SPACE
CANNON, or BOMBARDMENT abilities. Particularly valuable for PDS-heavy
factions (Titans of Ul, Muaat, etc.) who can get extra SPACE CANNON
dice. Trade value: 3-4 TG.</p>
<h3 id="h.-mech---aerie-sentinel">H. Mech - <strong>Aerie
Sentinel</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | <strong>Sustain Damage</strong></p>
<p>This unit does not count against capacity if it is being transported
or if it is in a space area with 1 or more of your ships that have
capacity values.</p>
<p>Free capacity mechs are excellent for invasions. Pair with your
destroyer capacity to transport mechs without using carrier space. Very
efficient for landing invasions.</p>
<h3 id="i.-flagship---quetzecoatl">I. Flagship -
<strong>Quetzecoatl</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 8 | Combat: 7 (x2) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 3 | <strong>Sustain
Damage</strong></p>
<p>Other players cannot use SPACE CANNON against your ships in this
system.</p>
<p>Solid flagship. SPACE CANNON immunity is situationally strong. Useful
for assaulting heavily fortified systems with PDS networks without
taking pre-combat damage.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Coolest flagship name in the game.</p>
<h3 id="j.-breakthrough---wing-transfer-by">J. Breakthrough -
<strong>Wing Transfer (B&lt;&gt;Y)</strong></h3>
<p>When you activate a system that contains only your units, you may
place command tokens from your reinforcements into any systems adjacent
to that system that contain only your units; at the end of this action,
you may move ships among the active system and systems adjacent to it
that contain your command tokens.</p>
<p><strong>B&lt;&gt;Y Synergy:</strong> Blue and yellow technologies
count as each other for prerequisites. This opens up tech
flexibility—Sarween Tools (Y) can count as blue, Gravity Drive (B) can
count as yellow, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The breakthrough ability itself is pretty bad
(requires only your units in systems, awkward activation). You get this
primarily for the B&lt;&gt;Y tech synergy to open up blue tech
options.</p>
<h3 id="k.-slice-and-draft-considerations">K. Slice and Draft
Considerations</h3>
<p>Argent Flight is incredibly flexible and can thrive in any speaker
position. Your priority is getting a high-value slice:</p>
<p><strong>Speaker Order:</strong> - <strong>Flexible for any
position</strong> - Argent doesn’t need to be first or last. Focus on
getting the best slice available rather than speaker position.</p>
<p><strong>Slice Priorities:</strong> - <strong>High value
slice</strong> - Lots of planets, lots of resources, AND lots of
influence. Argent wants it all. - <strong>Slight priority to
influence</strong> - Your fleets are cheap (destroyers cost 1), so you
can afford to spend resources on production while using influence for
more activations (command tokens). - <strong>Red and blue skips very
helpful</strong> - Red skip accelerates Strike Wing Alpha II, blue skip
helps Gravity Drive. But you’ve planned around all scenarios—incredibly
flexible. - <strong>Double planet systems in the middle</strong> -
Excellent for PDS coverage. You can place PDS on both planets and lock
down the system with SPACE CANNON. - <strong>Planets next to Mecatol
Rex</strong> - Lets you build PDS and SPACE CANNON approaching fleets
before they reach MR. Also makes Intimidate the Council (ships in 2
systems adjacent to MR) easier to score.</p>
<p><strong>Slice Features (Preferred):</strong> - High planet count with
balanced or influence-leaning resources - Tech skips (red/blue ideal,
but any skip helps) - Multi-planet systems for efficient PDS networks -
Systems with good resource/influence totals</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Argent is one of the most flexible factions
in draft. You can adapt to any slice quality and any speaker position.
Focus on grabbing the highest total value slice (planets + resources +
influence combined) rather than worrying about specific features. Your
strong starting fleet and flexible tech path let you work with almost
anything.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iv.-structural-weaknesses">IV. Structural Weaknesses</h2>
<h3 id="a.-first-turn-priorities">A. First Turn Priorities</h3>
<p>Your R1 priority order: <strong>Scoring &gt; Tech &gt; Production
&gt; Breakthrough</strong></p>
<p>Argent needs a quick start to capitalize on their strong early game.
Focus on: 1. <strong>Scoring</strong> - Expand to score your R1 Stage I
objective while you’re strong. Use your early power to get points on the
board. 2. <strong>Tech</strong> - Get on your tech path early 3.
<strong>Production</strong> - Build units to solidify your position 4.
<strong>Breakthrough</strong> - Secure Wing Transfer if going that
route</p>
<p><strong>Expansion Notes:</strong> You have 2 destroyers (capacity 1
each), 1 carrier (capacity 4), and 5 infantry. This gives you incredible
expansion flexibility—you can send each destroyer independently to grab
2 systems 2-move away, and use your carrier for a 3rd system. Aim for
3-4 systems R1. Consider nabbing an equidistant planet if your neighbor
is a trade-minded faction who won’t contest it aggressively.</p>
<p>You have 3 home planets which helps with objectives and gives you an
extra command token R1 (one planet provides the token). Only 3 resources
base means you need to expand to fuel production.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy Token Priority:</strong> If you have extra strategy
tokens, prioritize: Tech, Diplomacy, Construction/Warfare</p>
<h3 id="b.-late-game-scaling">B. Late Game Scaling</h3>
<p>Argent can struggle in late game for two reasons: 1. <strong>Big
capital ship fleets</strong> - Opponents building dreadnoughts and war
suns reduces the value of your AFB advantage 2. <strong>Lack of
transport capacity</strong> - Relying on destroyers with capacity 1
makes it hard to move large armies and mechs around the board late
game</p>
<p>You’ll need to transition to carriers and heavier ships for capacity,
or lean on structure lockdown strategy with Aerie Hololattice.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="v.-technology">V. Technology</h2>
<h3 id="a.-overview">A. Overview</h3>
<p>You start with <strong>TWO technologies of your choice</strong> from
Neural Motivator (G), Sarween Tools (Y), or Plasma Scoring (R).</p>
<p><strong>Recommended R1 Tech Choices:</strong> - <strong>Sarween Tools
+ Plasma Scoring</strong> - The only reasonable choice. Gives
flexibility and easy expansion.</p>
<p>Your main tech path focuses on Strike Wing Alpha II (RR) for
destroyer dominance. Deviations available for structure setup if
needed.</p>
<h3 id="b.-tech-path-standard">B. Tech Path (Standard)</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Tech Choices:</strong> Sarween Tools (Y) + Plasma
Scoring (R)</p>
<p><strong>Assumptions:</strong> You’ve obtained Wing Transfer
breakthrough (B&lt;&gt;Y synergy) through expedition tokens or Thunder’s
Edge. This makes blue and yellow technologies count as each other for
prerequisites.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1: Magen Defense Grid (R)</strong> - At the start of
ground combat on a planet that contains 1 or more of your structures,
you may produce 1 hit and assign it to 1 of your opponent’s ground
forces. (Ω) When any player activates a system that contains 1 or more
of your structures, place 1 infantry from your reinforcements with each
of those structures. - <strong>Why:</strong> Free infantry on your
structure planets when activated, AND free hit in ground combat.
Excellent defensive tech. Easy to get with Plasma Scoring prerequisite.
- <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 1 red (Plasma Scoring)</p>
<p><strong>Round 2: Aerie Hololattice (Y) - CAN DOUBLE TECH</strong> -
Other players cannot move ships through systems that contain your
structures. Each planet that contains 1 or more of your structures gains
the PRODUCTION: 1 ability as if it were a unit. - <strong>Why:</strong>
Blocks enemy movement through your systems (insane lockdown), AND makes
every structure planet produce units without needing a space dock.
Game-changing for board control. - <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 1
yellow (Sarween Tools) - <strong>Note:</strong> If you have good
economy, consider double teching this round to get ahead on tech
path.</p>
<p><strong>Round 3: Strike Wing Alpha II (RR) - CAN DOUBLE TECH</strong>
- Cost: 1 | Combat: 7 | Move: 2 | Capacity: 1 | ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE 6
(x3) - When this unit uses ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE, each result of 9 or 10
also destroys 1 of your opponent’s infantry in the space area of the
active system. - <strong>Why:</strong> This is your power spike. Better
AFB (6 instead of 9), 3 dice instead of 2, AND kills infantry in space
with 9-10 rolls. Devastating destroyer upgrade that defines your combat
superiority. - <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 2 red (Plasma Scoring +
Magen Defense Grid) - <strong>Note:</strong> Try to trade/exchange for
Wing Transfer breakthrough this round if you haven’t obtained it yet
through exploration. You’ll need it for Round 4. Can double tech this
round if economy permits.</p>
<p><strong>Round 4: DOUBLE TECH ROUND</strong></p>
<p><strong>With Wing Transfer Breakthrough:</strong> - <strong>Gravity
Drive (B)</strong> - After you activate a system, apply +1 to the move
value of 1 of your ships during this tactical action. -
<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 1 blue (Sarween Tools counts as blue
with B&lt;&gt;Y) - <strong>PDS II (RY)</strong> - Planetary Shield |
SPACE CANNON 5 | You may use this unit’s SPACE CANNON against ships that
are adjacent to this unit’s system. - <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 1
red + 1 yellow (Plasma Scoring + Sarween Tools) - <strong>Why:</strong>
Hit adjacent systems with SPACE CANNON. Area denial and PDS spam
strategy. Works with your Commander for extra die.</p>
<p><strong>Without Wing Transfer Breakthrough (or with blue
skip):</strong> - <strong>Antimass Deflectors (B) or Dark Energy Tap
(B)</strong> - Get blue prerequisite to join tech path - Antimass
Deflectors: Your ships can move into and through asteroid fields. When
other players’ units use SPACE CANNON against your units, apply -1 to
the result of each die roll. - Dark Energy Tap: After you perform a
tactical action in a system that contains a frontier token, if you have
1 or more ships in that system, explore that token. Your ships can
retreat into adjacent systems that do not contain other players’ units
even if you do not have units or control planets in that system. -
<strong>Gravity Drive (B)</strong> - After you activate a system, apply
+1 to the move value of 1 of your ships during this tactical action. -
<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 1 blue (Antimass or DET) - <strong>Skip
PDS II</strong> - Without breakthrough, prioritize getting into blue
tech path over PDS II</p>
<p><strong>Round 5: Carrier II (BB)</strong> - Cost: 3 | Combat: 9 |
Move: 2 | Capacity: 6 - <strong>Why:</strong> Solves late game capacity
issues. Move 6 ground forces at speed 2. Essential for large invasions
since destroyers only have capacity 1. - <strong>Prerequisites:</strong>
2 blue (Sarween + Gravity Drive with B&lt;&gt;Y synergy, OR Antimass/DET
+ Gravity Drive)</p>
<p><strong>Flex Techs (as needed):</strong> Lightwave Deflector, Fleet
Logistics - good options based on objectives</p>
<p><strong>Tech Path Summary:</strong></p>
<p><strong>With Wing Transfer Breakthrough:</strong> 1. Magen Defense
Grid (R) - Defense + free infantry 2. Aerie Hololattice (Y) - Structure
lockdown + production 3. Strike Wing Alpha II (RR) - Destroyer power
spike 4. Gravity Drive (B) + PDS II (RY) - Mobility + SPACE CANNON spam
(double tech) 5. Carrier II (BB) - Capacity</p>
<p><strong>Without Wing Transfer Breakthrough:</strong> 1. Magen Defense
Grid (R) - Defense + free infantry 2. Aerie Hololattice (Y) - Structure
lockdown + production 3. Strike Wing Alpha II (RR) - Destroyer power
spike 4. Antimass Deflectors/Dark Energy Tap (B) + Gravity Drive (B) -
Join blue tech path (double tech, skip PDS II) 5. Carrier II (BB) -
Capacity</p>
<p><strong>Key Notes:</strong> - <strong>Double tech possible R2, R3,
R4</strong> - If you have good economy, you can double tech any of these
rounds to accelerate your tech path - <strong>Round 4 double
tech</strong> - With breakthrough: Gravity Drive + PDS II. Without
breakthrough: Antimass/DET + Gravity Drive (skip PDS II) - <strong>With
Wing Transfer breakthrough:</strong> Sarween counts as blue
prerequisite, can get both Gravity Drive and PDS II in R4 -
<strong>Without breakthrough:</strong> Must get Antimass/DET to join
blue tech path, skip PDS II - <strong>With red skip:</strong> Skip Magen
R1, go straight to Strike Wing Alpha II R2 - <strong>With blue
skip:</strong> Skip Antimass/DET, go straight to Gravity Drive</p>
<h3 id="c.-diversions">C. Diversions</h3>
<p><strong>Scanlink Drone Network (0):</strong> -
<strong>Timing:</strong> Pick up early if your slice is influence-heavy
and resource-poor - When you activate a system, you may explore 1 planet
in that system that contains 1 or more of your units. -
<strong>Why:</strong> Resource creation through self-activation with
Sarween + Scanlink combo. Each exploration gives you
resources/commodities while Sarween reduces production costs. -
<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> None (0) - <strong>Note:</strong> This
path completely skips blue tech. Focus on red/yellow ship upgrades and
use exploration to compensate for lack of mobility/capacity techs.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vi.-strategy-cards">VI. Strategy Cards</h2>
<h3 id="a.-round-1-priority">A. Round 1 Priority</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Trade</strong> - Get economy flowing early, extra TGs are
solid</li>
<li><strong>Leadership</strong> - Great in round 1. Command tokens for
more diversity in early game. Can be great in christmas land.</li>
<li><strong>Technology</strong> - Critical for getting on your tech path
early, especially with skips</li>
<li><strong>Construction</strong> - Important for structure/PDS path and
building economy with Aerie Hololattice</li>
<li><strong>Politics</strong> - Speaker token is fine, voting first on
agendas is neutral</li>
<li><strong>Warfare</strong> - Your starting fleet is already strong
enough for R1 expansion, less critical</li>
<li><strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Only for securing resource-rich planets
or breakthrough opportunities, not for defense</li>
<li><strong>Imperial</strong> - Never R1</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="b.-round-2-priority">B. Round 2+ Priority</h3>
<p><strong>Love:</strong> - <strong>Trade</strong> - Consistent economy
- <strong>Leadership</strong> - Command tokens for production
secondaries and multi-system presence</p>
<p><strong>Like:</strong> - <strong>Technology</strong> - Tech
progression toward Strike Wing Alpha II or Aerie Hololattice. Need to
take this at least once R2-R4 to stay on your tech path. -
<strong>Politics</strong> - You have voting power, but voting first
limits your kingmaking ability. Good for speaker token and agenda
influence. - <strong>Imperial</strong> - Pick when ready to score
(R3-R4), good for claiming points once you’re positioned -
<strong>Construction</strong> - Always good for building PDS networks
and structures with Aerie Hololattice/Magen synergies</p>
<p><strong>Situational:</strong> - <strong>Warfare</strong> - Only if
playing very aggressively with destroyer spam. The redistribution + free
activation can be strong, but not always needed.</p>
<p><strong>Hate:</strong> - <strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Rarely useful
for Argent. Your strong starting fleet doesn’t need defensive plays, and
locking systems late game is not worth the strategy card pick.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vii.-intermediate">VII. Intermediate</h2>
<h3 id="a.-unit-composition">A. Unit Composition</h3>
<p>Your ideal fleet composition in each system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Destroyers (Strike Wing Alpha) + Fighter screen</strong> -
Core of your fleet for AFB and cheap production</li>
<li><strong>1 Carrier</strong> - For capacity and additional
fighters</li>
<li><strong>1 Flagship (optional)</strong> - For additional combat hits
and Sustain Damage</li>
<li><strong>1-2 Dreadnoughts (if heavy resources)</strong> - Add a few
dreads if you have strong resource economy</li>
<li><strong>1-2 Mechs</strong> - Free capacity with Aerie Sentinel
ability</li>
<li><strong>Infantry</strong> - Standard ground forces</li>
</ul>
<p>This composition gives you strong ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE, affordable
production, and invasion capability. The mech’s free capacity makes
destroyer-based invasions viable without needing lots of carrier
capacity.</p>
<h3 id="b.-custodian-strategy">B. Custodian Strategy</h3>
<p>Argent Flight is an excellent “get in, get out” custodian faction.
You can easily afford the 6 influence to claim Mecatol Rex R2-R3—your
home system provides 3 influence, your destroyers cost only 1 resource
(leaving influence available for MR), and you’ll have expanded to
influence-heavy planets by then. Take MR early, grab the Custodians
token for a free 1 VP, then evaluate whether holding it is worth the
commitment. Your ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE and Raid Formation make you
dangerous enough that opponents might not immediately contest MR, giving
you breathing room. If going the Aerie Hololattice route, you can lock
down MR with structure placement on adjacent planets and PDS
networks—but be realistic: if you abandon MR, you probably won’t see it
again. Once you leave, another faction will take it and likely hold it
for the rest of the game. The key insight: don’t feel obligated to hold
MR forever, but understand that walking away means giving it up
permanently. Evaluate whether the custodians point is worth the eventual
loss of MR access.</p>

<p><strong>Legend:</strong> 🟢 Likely | 🟡 Possible | 🔴 Difficult</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> - Argent is strong at combat and political
objectives - Spending objectives are moderate—you need
resources/influence for production - Structure objectives favor you if
going Aerie Hololattice path - Mobility objectives favor you with cheap
destroyers and good movement</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="ix.-alliance-priority">IX. Alliance Priority</h2>
<p>Trading for other factions’ Alliance promissory notes (which give you
access to their Commanders) can significantly boost your strategy. Here
are the top alliances to prioritize:</p>
<p><strong>Super Top Tier:</strong> 1. <strong>Jol-Nar (Ta
Zern)</strong> - Reroll dice for unit abilities. Massively boosts AFB,
SPACE CANNON, BOMBARDMENT reliability. Perfect synergy. 2.
<strong>Titans of Ul (Tungstantus)</strong> - When you use PRODUCTION,
gain 1 trade good. Great for destroyer spam economy and constant
production. 3. <strong>Nomad (Navarch Feng)</strong> - Produce flagship
without spending resources. Saves 8 resources for destroyer production
instead. 4. <strong>Winnu (Rickar Rickani)</strong> - +2 combat in MR,
your home system, and legendary planet systems. Strong combat boost for
key battles.</p>
<p><strong>Really Useful:</strong> 5. <strong>Empyrean (Xuange)</strong>
- After another player moves ships into a system that contains your
command tokens, return that token to your reinforcements. Excellent for
getting tokens back when opponents activate systems with your
structures/units. More tokens = more production and tech secondaries. 6.
<strong>Xxcha (Elder Qanoj)</strong> - Each planet exhausted provides 1
additional vote. With 3 home planets, decent voting boost. Bonus:
Xxcha’s Alliance (Duplimatic) lets you use their faction abilities,
which can be useful. 7. <strong>Yin (Brother Omar)</strong> - Satisfies
green prerequisite. When you research tech owned by another player,
return 1 infantry to ignore prerequisites. Tech path flexibility if you
don’t get Wing Transfer breakthrough. 8. <strong>Muaat (Magmus)</strong>
- After you spend strategy token, gain 1 trade good. Economy boost for
tech-focused playstyle.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="x.-end-notes">X. End Notes</h2>
<p>Argent Flight is a powerhouse combat faction with flexible builds.
Your job is to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Expand aggressively R1-R2</strong> (use cheap destroyers and
3 home planets to claim territory)</li>
<li><strong>Decide on your path R2-R3</strong> - Destroyer rush (AFB
spam) or Aerie Hololattice (PDS networks + structure lockdown)</li>
<li><strong>Leverage AFB dominance</strong> - Make fighter screens
worthless with Raid Formation, shred capital ships with excess hits</li>
<li><strong>Stay ahead on points</strong> - Find a way to be in the
running points-wise. Hopefully your slice setup is enough of a deterrent
to keep you alive when playing from ahead.</li>
<li><strong>Control space with firepower</strong> - Destroyers for
direct combat, PDS for area denial</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t let anyone underestimate your firepower. You’re a top-tier
combat faction with explosive early game and brutal unit abilities. Spam
destroyers, blast with PDS, and overwhelm your enemies with
cost-efficient destruction.</p>
