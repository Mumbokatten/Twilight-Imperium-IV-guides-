# Argent Flight Guide

![Argent Flight Strike Wing](ArgentFlightArt.webp)

---

## I. Introduction

Argent Flight is one of the most explosive combat factions in TI4. This faction excels at obliterating fighter screens with devastating ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE, spamming cheap destroyers for early aggression, and blasting enemies with PDS networks. Argent Flight isn't subtle—it's about destroying your opponents' fleets efficiently and controlling space through superior firepower.

The payoff? Watching opponents realize their fighters are target practice for your Raid Formation, seeing capital ships get shredded by excess AFB hits, and denying entire systems with PDS coverage. When your destroyers arrive, space combat becomes a massacre.

## II. Playstyle

Playing Argent Flight is like commanding a swarm of angry space hornets with laser turrets. Your cheap Strike Wing Alpha destroyers swarm the map early, your ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE shreds through fighter screens AND damages capital ships via Raid Formation, and your PDS networks deny movement and blast approaching fleets before combat even starts.

The key strength of Argent Flight is cost-efficient destruction. Spam cheap destroyers with brutal AFB, leverage your Commander for extra dice on unit abilities (AFB, SPACE CANNON, BOMBARDMENT), and force opponents to either avoid you or bring expensive capital ships. You win through volume of fire and efficiency.

Opponents will respect your firepower early. That moment when your 2 destroyers delete an entire fighter screen and damage a dreadnought with excess AFB hits? Utterly satisfying.

## III. The Basics

### A. Home System & Commodities

**Home System:**
- **Ylir:** 0 resources / 2 influence = 2 optimal influence
- **Valk:** 2 resources / 0 influence = 2 optimal resources
- **Avar:** 1 resource / 1 influence = 0.5 optimal resources + 0.5 optimal influence
- **Total: 3 resources / 3 influence (2.5 optimal resources / 2.5 optimal influence)**

**Commodities:** 3

**Notes:** Three planets in your home system is fantastic for early expansion and objectives. The optimal count (2.5/2.5) means you have flexibility—Avar's balanced 1/1 can be spent as either resources or influence depending on what you need.

**Defense Issue:** 3-planet home systems are harder to defend late game—you need to spread ground forces across 3 planets instead of 1-2, making it easier for opponents to invade. You'll need to rely on PDS networks and Aerie Hololattice (blocks movement through systems with your structures) to keep your home system safe.

### B. Starting Fleet

- 1 Carrier
- 2 Destroyers (Strike Wing Alpha I)
- 2 Fighters
- 5 Infantry
- 1 Space Dock
- 1 PDS

**Notes:** One of the best starting fleets in the game. Your 2 destroyers each have capacity 1, and you have 5 infantry—this lets you send each destroyer 2 systems away from your home system to claim planets independently. You can take 2 systems that are 2-move away on R1, giving you incredible expansion reach. This makes it nearly impossible to find an unplayable slice for Argent—you can reach almost any planet configuration.

### C. Starting Technologies

**Choose TWO of the following:**
- **Neural Motivator (Green)** - Provides green prerequisite
- **Sarween Tools (Yellow)** - Reduces production costs by 1 resource
- **Plasma Scoring (Red)** - Provides red prerequisite and combat boost

**Recommended:** **Sarween Tools + Plasma Scoring** - This is the only reasonable choice. Gives you flexibility and enables easy expansion. Sarween provides economy and leads to Aerie Hololattice (Y) if going structure path. Plasma Scoring leads to Strike Wing Alpha II (RR). Neural Motivator is bait—green doesn't lead to any techs Argent actually wants.

### D. Faction Abilities

**Zeal (Faction Ability):** You always vote first during the agenda phase. When you cast at least 1 vote, cast 1 additional vote for each player in the game, including you.

Strong voting power with a downside. In a 6-player game, casting 1 vote becomes 7 votes total (1 + 6 bonus). However, voting first means you commit your votes before seeing what others do—you can't kingmake or react. You're forced to vote your interest, then others decide if they want to pile on or counter you. Trade your votes for favors when you don't care about the outcome.

**Raid Formation (Faction Ability):** When 1 or more of your units use ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE, for each hit produced in excess of your opponent's fighters, choose 1 of your opponent's ships that has Sustain Damage to become damaged.

This makes your ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE terrifying. After destroying all fighters, excess hits go straight to capital ships with Sustain Damage. Fighter screens become a liability against you.

**Strike Wing Alpha I (Destroyer):** Cost: 1 | Combat: 8 | Move: 2 | Capacity: 1 | ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE 9 (x2)

Your bread and butter. Cheap destroyers with AFB and capacity for transporting infantry. Mass produce these early game.

### E. Leaders

**Agent - Trilossa Aun Mirik:** When a player produces ground forces in a system: You may exhaust this card; that player may place those units on any planets they control in that system and any adjacent systems.

Useful for helping players with flexible ground force placement. Trade incentive or favor generator.

**Commander - Trrakan Aun Zulok:** *Unlock: Have 6 units that have ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE, SPACE CANNON, or BOMBARDMENT on the game board.*

When 1 or more of your units make a roll for a unit ability: You may choose 1 of those units to roll 1 additional die.

Easy to unlock with destroyers and PDS. Significantly boosts your ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE, SPACE CANNON, and BOMBARDMENT effectiveness. Aim to unlock Round 2-3 (R2-R3).

**Hero - Mirik Aun Sissiri:** *Unlock: Have 3 scored objectives.* **Helix Protocol** - ACTION: Move any number of your ships from any systems to any number of other systems that contain 1 of your command tokens and no other players' ships. Then, purge this card.

Massive repositioning tool. Use for surprise attacks, defensive regrouping, or scoring movement objectives. Save for a critical moment—usually Round 4-5 (R4-R5) when positioning matters most for victory.

### F. Promissory Note - **Strike Wing Ambuscade**

When 1 or more of your units make a roll for a unit ability: Choose 1 of those units to roll 1 additional die. Then, return this card to the Argent player.

Useful for ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE, SPACE CANNON, or BOMBARDMENT users. Trade value: Max 1 TG. Sell this at every possible opportunity—trade it to the active player during their turn so it gets used and returned to you, rather than sitting unused in someone's hand.

### G. Alliance

**Alliance Ability:**
*While the Argent Flight player's commander is unlocked:*
*When 1 or more of your units make a roll for a unit ability, you may choose 1 of those units to roll 1 additional die.*

Excellent alliance for factions with ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE, SPACE CANNON, or BOMBARDMENT abilities. Particularly valuable for PDS-heavy factions (Titans of Ul, Muaat, etc.) who can get extra SPACE CANNON dice. Trade value: 3-4 TG.

### H. Mech - **Aerie Sentinel**

Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | **Sustain Damage**

This unit does not count against capacity if it is being transported or if it is in a space area with 1 or more of your ships that have capacity values.

Free capacity mechs are excellent for invasions. Pair with your destroyer capacity to transport mechs without using carrier space. Very efficient for landing invasions.

### I. Flagship - **Quetzecoatl**

Cost: 8 | Combat: 7 (x2) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 3 | **Sustain Damage**

Other players cannot use SPACE CANNON against your ships in this system.

Solid flagship. SPACE CANNON immunity is situationally strong. Useful for assaulting heavily fortified systems with PDS networks without taking pre-combat damage.

**Note:** Coolest flagship name in the game.

### J. Breakthrough - **Wing Transfer (B<>Y)**

When you activate a system that contains only your units, you may place command tokens from your reinforcements into any systems adjacent to that system that contain only your units; at the end of this action, you may move ships among the active system and systems adjacent to it that contain your command tokens.

**B<>Y Synergy:** Blue and yellow technologies count as each other for prerequisites. This opens up tech flexibility—Sarween Tools (Y) can count as blue, Gravity Drive (B) can count as yellow, etc.

**Note:** The breakthrough ability itself is pretty bad (requires only your units in systems, awkward activation). You get this primarily for the B<>Y tech synergy to open up blue tech options.

### K. Slice and Draft Considerations

Argent Flight is incredibly flexible and can thrive in any speaker position. Your priority is getting a high-value slice:

**Speaker Order:**
- **Flexible for any position** - Argent doesn't need to be first or last. Focus on getting the best slice available rather than speaker position.

**Slice Priorities:**
- **High value slice** - Lots of planets, lots of resources, AND lots of influence. Argent wants it all.
- **Slight priority to influence** - Your fleets are cheap (destroyers cost 1), so you can afford to spend resources on production while using influence for more activations (command tokens).
- **Red and blue skips very helpful** - Red skip accelerates Strike Wing Alpha II, blue skip helps Gravity Drive. But you've planned around all scenarios—incredibly flexible.
- **Double planet systems in the middle** - Excellent for PDS coverage. You can place PDS on both planets and lock down the system with SPACE CANNON.
- **Planets next to Mecatol Rex** - Lets you build PDS and SPACE CANNON approaching fleets before they reach MR. Also makes Intimidate the Council (ships in 2 systems adjacent to MR) easier to score.

**Slice Features (Preferred):**
- High planet count with balanced or influence-leaning resources
- Tech skips (red/blue ideal, but any skip helps)
- Multi-planet systems for efficient PDS networks
- Systems with good resource/influence totals

**Summary:**
Argent is one of the most flexible factions in draft. You can adapt to any slice quality and any speaker position. Focus on grabbing the highest total value slice (planets + resources + influence combined) rather than worrying about specific features. Your strong starting fleet and flexible tech path let you work with almost anything.

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

### A. First Turn Priorities

Your Round 1 (R1) priority order: **Scoring > Tech > Production > Breakthrough**

Argent needs a quick start to capitalize on their strong early game. Focus on:
1. **Scoring** - Expand to score your R1 Stage I objective while you're strong. Use your early power to get points on the board.
2. **Tech** - Get on your tech path early
3. **Production** - Build units to solidify your position
4. **Breakthrough** - Secure Wing Transfer if going that route

**Expansion Notes:** You have 2 destroyers (capacity 1 each), 1 carrier (capacity 4), and 5 infantry. This gives you incredible expansion flexibility—you can send each destroyer independently to grab 2 systems 2-move away, and use your carrier for a 3rd system. Aim for 3-4 systems R1. Consider nabbing an equidistant planet if your neighbor is a trade-minded faction who won't contest it aggressively.

You have 3 home planets which helps with objectives and gives you an extra command token R1 (one planet provides the token). Only 3 resources base means you need to expand to fuel production.

**Strategy Token Priority:** If you have extra strategy tokens, prioritize: Tech, Diplomacy, Construction/Warfare

### B. Late Game Scaling

Argent can struggle in late game for two reasons:
1. **Big capital ship fleets** - Opponents building dreadnoughts and war suns reduces the value of your AFB advantage
2. **Lack of transport capacity** - Relying on destroyers with capacity 1 makes it hard to move large armies and mechs around the board late game

You'll need to transition to carriers and heavier ships for capacity, or lean on structure lockdown strategy with Aerie Hololattice.

---

## V. Technology

### A. Overview

You start with **TWO technologies of your choice** from Neural Motivator (G), Sarween Tools (Y), or Plasma Scoring (R).

**Recommended R1 Tech Choices:**
- **Sarween Tools + Plasma Scoring** - The only reasonable choice. Gives flexibility and easy expansion.

Your main tech path focuses on Strike Wing Alpha II (RR) for destroyer dominance. Deviations available for structure setup if needed.

### B. Tech Path (Standard)

**Starting Tech Choices:** Sarween Tools (Y) + Plasma Scoring (R)

**Assumptions:** You've obtained Wing Transfer breakthrough (B<>Y synergy) through expedition tokens or Thunder's Edge. This makes blue and yellow technologies count as each other for prerequisites.

**Round 1: Magen Defense Grid (R)**
- At the start of ground combat on a planet that contains 1 or more of your structures, you may produce 1 hit and assign it to 1 of your opponent's ground forces. (Ω) When any player activates a system that contains 1 or more of your structures, place 1 infantry from your reinforcements with each of those structures.
- **Why:** Free infantry on your structure planets when activated, AND free hit in ground combat. Excellent defensive tech. Easy to get with Plasma Scoring prerequisite.
- **Prerequisites:** 1 red (Plasma Scoring)

**Round 2: Aerie Hololattice (Y) - CAN DOUBLE TECH**
- Other players cannot move ships through systems that contain your structures. Each planet that contains 1 or more of your structures gains the PRODUCTION: 1 ability as if it were a unit.
- **Why:** Blocks enemy movement through your systems (insane lockdown), AND makes every structure planet produce units without needing a space dock. Game-changing for board control.
- **Prerequisites:** 1 yellow (Sarween Tools)
- **Note:** If you have good economy, consider double teching this round to get ahead on tech path.

**Round 3: Strike Wing Alpha II (RR) - CAN DOUBLE TECH**
- Cost: 1 | Combat: 7 | Move: 2 | Capacity: 1 | ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE 6 (x3)
- When this unit uses ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE, each result of 9 or 10 also destroys 1 of your opponent's infantry in the space area of the active system.
- **Why:** This is your power spike. Better AFB (6 instead of 9), 3 dice instead of 2, AND kills infantry in space with 9-10 rolls. Devastating destroyer upgrade that defines your combat superiority.
- **Prerequisites:** 2 red (Plasma Scoring + Magen Defense Grid)
- **Note:** Try to trade/exchange for Wing Transfer breakthrough this round if you haven't obtained it yet through exploration. You'll need it for Round 4. Can double tech this round if economy permits.

**Round 4: DOUBLE TECH ROUND**

**With Wing Transfer Breakthrough:**
- **Gravity Drive (B)** - After you activate a system, apply +1 to the move value of 1 of your ships during this tactical action.
  - **Prerequisites:** 1 blue (Sarween Tools counts as blue with B<>Y)
- **PDS II (RY)** - Planetary Shield | SPACE CANNON 5 | You may use this unit's SPACE CANNON against ships that are adjacent to this unit's system.
  - **Prerequisites:** 1 red + 1 yellow (Plasma Scoring + Sarween Tools)
  - **Why:** Hit adjacent systems with SPACE CANNON. Area denial and PDS spam strategy. Works with your Commander for extra die.

**Without Wing Transfer Breakthrough (or with blue skip):**
- **Antimass Deflectors (B) or Dark Energy Tap (B)** - Get blue prerequisite to join tech path
  - Antimass Deflectors: Your ships can move into and through asteroid fields. When other players' units use SPACE CANNON against your units, apply -1 to the result of each die roll.
  - Dark Energy Tap: After you perform a tactical action in a system that contains a frontier token, if you have 1 or more ships in that system, explore that token. Your ships can retreat into adjacent systems that do not contain other players' units even if you do not have units or control planets in that system.
- **Gravity Drive (B)** - After you activate a system, apply +1 to the move value of 1 of your ships during this tactical action.
  - **Prerequisites:** 1 blue (Antimass or DET)
- **Skip PDS II** - Without breakthrough, prioritize getting into blue tech path over PDS II

**Round 5: Carrier II (BB)**
- Cost: 3 | Combat: 9 | Move: 2 | Capacity: 6
- **Why:** Solves late game capacity issues. Move 6 ground forces at speed 2. Essential for large invasions since destroyers only have capacity 1.
- **Prerequisites:** 2 blue (Sarween + Gravity Drive with B<>Y synergy, OR Antimass/DET + Gravity Drive)

**Flex Techs (as needed):** Lightwave Deflector, Fleet Logistics - good options based on objectives

**Tech Path Summary:**

**With Wing Transfer Breakthrough:**
1. Magen Defense Grid (R) - Defense + free infantry
2. Aerie Hololattice (Y) - Structure lockdown + production
3. Strike Wing Alpha II (RR) - Destroyer power spike
4. Gravity Drive (B) + PDS II (RY) - Mobility + SPACE CANNON spam (double tech)
5. Carrier II (BB) - Capacity

**Without Wing Transfer Breakthrough:**
1. Magen Defense Grid (R) - Defense + free infantry
2. Aerie Hololattice (Y) - Structure lockdown + production
3. Strike Wing Alpha II (RR) - Destroyer power spike
4. Antimass Deflectors/Dark Energy Tap (B) + Gravity Drive (B) - Join blue tech path (double tech, skip PDS II)
5. Carrier II (BB) - Capacity

**Key Notes:**
- **Double tech possible R2, R3, R4** - If you have good economy, you can double tech any of these rounds to accelerate your tech path
- **Round 4 double tech** - With breakthrough: Gravity Drive + PDS II. Without breakthrough: Antimass/DET + Gravity Drive (skip PDS II)
- **With Wing Transfer breakthrough:** Sarween counts as blue prerequisite, can get both Gravity Drive and PDS II in R4
- **Without breakthrough:** Must get Antimass/DET to join blue tech path, skip PDS II
- **With red skip:** Skip Magen R1, go straight to Strike Wing Alpha II R2
- **With blue skip:** Skip Antimass/DET, go straight to Gravity Drive

### C. Diversions

**Scanlink Drone Network (0):**
- **Timing:** Pick up early if your slice is influence-heavy and resource-poor
- When you activate a system, you may explore 1 planet in that system that contains 1 or more of your units.
- **Why:** Resource creation through self-activation with Sarween + Scanlink combo. Each exploration gives you resources/commodities while Sarween reduces production costs.
- **Prerequisites:** None (0)
- **Note:** This path completely skips blue tech. Focus on red/yellow ship upgrades and use exploration to compensate for lack of mobility/capacity techs.

## VI. Strategy Cards

### A. Round 1 Priority

1. **Trade** - Get economy flowing early, extra TGs are solid
2. **Leadership** - Great in round 1. Command tokens for more diversity in early game. Can be great in christmas land.
3. **Technology** - Critical for getting on your tech path early, especially with skips
4. **Construction** - Important for structure/PDS path and building economy with Aerie Hololattice
5. **Politics** - Speaker token is fine, voting first on agendas is neutral
6. **Warfare** - Your starting fleet is already strong enough for R1 expansion, less critical
7. **Diplomacy** - Only for securing resource-rich planets or breakthrough opportunities, not for defense
8. **Imperial** - Never R1

### B. Round 2+ Priority

**Love:**
- **Trade** - Consistent economy
- **Leadership** - Command tokens for production secondaries and multi-system presence

**Like:**
- **Technology** - Tech progression toward Strike Wing Alpha II or Aerie Hololattice. Need to take this at least once R2-R4 to stay on your tech path.
- **Politics** - You have voting power, but voting first limits your kingmaking ability. Good for speaker token and agenda influence.
- **Imperial** - Pick when ready to score (R3-R4), good for claiming points once you're positioned
- **Construction** - Always good for building PDS networks and structures with Aerie Hololattice/Magen synergies

**Situational:**
- **Warfare** - Only if playing very aggressively with destroyer spam. The redistribution + free activation can be strong, but not always needed.

**Hate:**
- **Diplomacy** - Rarely useful for Argent. Your strong starting fleet doesn't need defensive plays, and locking systems late game is not worth the strategy card pick.

---

## VII. Intermediate

### A. Unit Composition

Your ideal fleet composition in each system:

- **Destroyers (Strike Wing Alpha) + Fighter screen** - Core of your fleet for AFB and cheap production
- **1 Carrier** - For capacity and additional fighters
- **1 Flagship (optional)** - For additional combat hits and Sustain Damage
- **1-2 Dreadnoughts (if heavy resources)** - Add a few dreads if you have strong resource economy
- **1-2 Mechs** - Free capacity with Aerie Sentinel ability
- **Infantry** - Standard ground forces

This composition gives you strong ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE, affordable production, and invasion capability. The mech's free capacity makes destroyer-based invasions viable without needing lots of carrier capacity.

### B. Custodian Strategy

Argent Flight is an excellent "get in, get out" custodian faction. You can easily afford the 6 influence to claim Mecatol Rex Round 2-3 (R2-R3)—your home system provides 3 influence, your destroyers cost only 1 resource (leaving influence available for MR), and you'll have expanded to influence-heavy planets by then. Take MR early, grab the Custodians token for a free 1 VP, then evaluate whether holding it is worth the commitment. Your ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE and Raid Formation make you dangerous enough that opponents might not immediately contest MR, giving you breathing room. If going the Aerie Hololattice route, you can lock down MR with structure placement on adjacent planets and PDS networks—but be realistic: if you abandon MR, you probably won't see it again. Once you leave, another faction will take it and likely hold it for the rest of the game. The key insight: don't feel obligated to hold MR forever, but understand that walking away means giving it up permanently. Evaluate whether the custodians point is worth the eventual loss of MR access.

---

## VIII. Objectives

### A. Objective Summary

**Strengths:** Argent Flight excels at combat-oriented objectives and can easily score fleet composition goals with cheap destroyer spam. Structure objectives are achievable when going the Aerie Hololattice path, and strong voting power helps with political objectives.

**Weaknesses:** Planet control objectives can be challenging since you prioritize mobile fleets over territorial expansion. Late game capacity limitations from destroyer-focused fleets make large-scale invasions difficult without transitioning to carriers.

**Legend:** 🟢 Likely | 🟡 Possible | 🔴 Difficult

**Notes:**
- Argent is strong at combat and political objectives
- Spending objectives are moderate—you need resources/influence for production
- Structure objectives favor you if going Aerie Hololattice path
- Mobility objectives favor you with cheap destroyers and good movement

## IX. Alliance Priority

Trading for other factions' Alliance promissory notes (which give you access to their Commanders) can significantly boost your strategy. Here are the top alliances to prioritize:

**Super Top Tier:**
1. **Jol-Nar (Ta Zern)** - Reroll dice for unit abilities. Massively boosts AFB, SPACE CANNON, BOMBARDMENT reliability. Perfect synergy.
2. **Titans of Ul (Tungstantus)** - When you use PRODUCTION, gain 1 trade good. Great for destroyer spam economy and constant production.
3. **Nomad (Navarch Feng)** - Produce flagship without spending resources. Saves 8 resources for destroyer production instead.
4. **Winnu (Rickar Rickani)** - +2 combat in MR, your home system, and legendary planet systems. Strong combat boost for key battles.

**Really Useful:**
5. **Empyrean (Xuange)** - After another player moves ships into a system that contains your command tokens, return that token to your reinforcements. Excellent for getting tokens back when opponents activate systems with your structures/units. More tokens = more production and tech secondaries.
6. **Xxcha (Elder Qanoj)** - Each planet exhausted provides 1 additional vote. With 3 home planets, decent voting boost. Bonus: Xxcha's Alliance (Duplimatic) lets you use their faction abilities, which can be useful.
7. **Yin (Brother Omar)** - Satisfies green prerequisite. When you research tech owned by another player, return 1 infantry to ignore prerequisites. Tech path flexibility if you don't get Wing Transfer breakthrough.
8. **Muaat (Magmus)** - After you spend strategy token, gain 1 trade good. Economy boost for tech-focused playstyle.

## XI. End Notes

Argent Flight is a powerhouse combat faction with flexible builds. Your job is to:

1. **Expand aggressively Round 1-2** (use cheap destroyers and 3 home planets to claim territory)
2. **Decide on your path R2-R3** - Destroyer rush (AFB spam) or Aerie Hololattice (PDS networks + structure lockdown)
3. **Leverage AFB dominance** - Make fighter screens worthless with Raid Formation, shred capital ships with excess hits
4. **Stay ahead on points** - Find a way to be in the running points-wise. Hopefully your slice setup is enough of a deterrent to keep you alive when playing from ahead.
5. **Control space with firepower** - Destroyers for direct combat, PDS for area denial

Don't let anyone underestimate your firepower. You're a top-tier combat faction with explosive early game and brutal unit abilities. Spam destroyers, blast with PDS, and overwhelm your enemies with cost-efficient destruction.
