# Council Keleres Guide

![Council Keleres](KeleresArt.jpg)

---

## I. Introduction

The Council Keleres is TI4's most adaptable faction, built around choosing one of three sub-factions (Argent Flight, Mentak Coalition, or Xxcha Kingdom) and inheriting their home system. This faction excels at political manipulation, economic consistency, Mecatol Rex control, and insane production capabilities. Keleres isn't about raw power—it's about flexibility, agenda control, and leveraging political influence to shape the game.

The payoff? Watching opponents realize you've controlled every agenda that matters, seeing your economy stay consistent with Council Patronage, producing on Mecatol Rex without a space dock thanks to Custodia Vigilia, and using Agency Supply Network to produce in two systems at once. When Keleres shows up, the galaxy bends to your will.

## II. Playstyle

Playing Council Keleres is like commanding a top-tier political powerhouse with military backup. Your Tribunii ability lets you choose between three different home systems (Argent/Mentak/Xxcha), giving you flexibility based on map position and strategy. Your Council Patronage gives you free trade goods every round. Your Law's Order lets you ignore laws when needed.

The key strength of Keleres is adaptability and consistency. Choose your home system wisely, leverage Council Patronage for steady economy, and use Executive Order tech to control agendas. You win through political dominance and strategic positioning. **Keleres excels at winning from ahead** - once you get your faction techs (Executive Order and Agency Supply Network), you become incredibly difficult to stop.

Opponents will struggle to predict your moves. That moment when they realize how many agendas they'll have to vote for and start crying? Just another day for Keleres.

## III. The Basics

### A. Home System & Commodities

**Home System Options (choose one during setup):**

**Argent Flight:**
- **Ylir:** 0 resources / 2 influence
- **Valk:** 2 resources / 0 influence
- **Avar:** 1 resource / 1 influence
- **Total: 3 resources / 3 influence (2.5 optimal resources / 2.5 optimal influence)**

**Mentak Coalition:**
- **Mol Primus:** 4 resources / 1 influence
- **Total: 4 resources / 1 influence (4 optimal resources / 0 optimal influence)**

**Xxcha Kingdom:**
- **Archon Ren:** 2 resources / 3 influence
- **Archon Tau:** 1 resource / 1 influence
- **Total: 3 resources / 4 influence (0.5 optimal resources / 3.5 optimal influence)**

**Commodities:** 2

**Notes:** Your home system choice fundamentally changes your economy and playstyle. **Mentak is the clear #1 choice** - one-planet home systems are far superior (easier to defend), you get 4 resources (best for production), and Mentak hero (Harka Leeds) is by far the best of the three, giving you 3 component action cards that combo with your commander for extra actions. Always pick Mentak if available.

Xxcha and Argent are a bit of a tossup. Multi-planet home systems are rough - if you lose space combat, you're defending multiple planets which is nearly impossible (Xxcha has 2 planets, Argent has 3). Argent has better total optimal value (2.5 + 2.5 = 5 optimal vs Xxcha's 0.5 + 3.5 = 4 optimal) and a better hero (Overwing Zeta gives you instant flagship + 2 cruisers/destroyers in combat), but both offer similar influence.

### B. Starting Fleet

- 2 Carriers
- 1 Cruiser
- 2 Fighters
- 2 Infantry
- 1 Space Dock

**Notes:** Rough starting fleet. While you have 2 carriers for capacity and a cruiser for combat, you only have 2 infantry, which greatly reduces your ability to expand early. You'll struggle to take multiple planets R1 compared to factions with more ground forces. Plan your expansion carefully.

### C. Starting Technologies

**Choose 2 non-faction technologies owned by other players**

**Optimal:** **Sarween Tools (Y)** + **Gravity Drive (B)**

**Notes:** You choose 2 non-faction techs owned by other players - this means you're limited to what your opponents have, not any 2 techs in the game. Sarween Tools gets you started on the yellow tech path, and Gravity Drive gives you the mobility to reach Mecatol Rex quickly. If these aren't available from other players, take any blue + yellow combination that is available. Your I.I.H.Q. Modernization breakthrough makes green and yellow count as each other for prerequisites, allowing green techs as well. See Section V (Technology) for detailed discussion of starting tech options and tech paths.

### D. Faction Abilities

**The Tribunii:** During setup, choose an unplayed faction from among the Mentak, the Xxcha, and the Argent Flight; take that faction's home system, command tokens, and control markers. Additionally, take the Keleres hero that corresponds to that faction.

Your defining ability. Choose your home system and starting command tokens from one of three factions. This also determines which hero you get (each has different abilities). Choose wisely based on map position, slice resources/influence, and strategy.

**Council Patronage:** Replenish your commodities at the start of the strategy phase, then gain 1 trade good.

Incredible economic consistency. Every strategy phase, you refresh your 2 commodities AND gain 1 TG for free. This gives you 3 TG worth of value every round (2 commodities + 1 TG). **Important:** You need a trade partner to wash your commodities into trade goods - don't be reliant on your agent to do this. Make friends and establish trade agreements so you can actually use your commodity value.

**Law's Order:** You may spend 1 Trade Good or Commodity to treat all laws as blank until the end of the turn.

Ultimate law flexibility. Spend 1 TG/commodity to ignore ALL laws for the entire turn. Use this strategically when laws would hurt you.

### E. Leaders

**Agent - Xander Alexin Victori III:** At any time: You may exhaust this card to allow any player to spend commodities as if they were trade goods.

Useful diplomatic tool. Convert anyone's commodities to trade goods instantly. Great for helping allies or yourself in critical moments. Good for making deals.

**Commander - Suffi An:** *Unlock: Spend 1 trade good after you play an action card that has a component action.*

After you perform a component action: You may perform an additional action.

Fairly easy unlock condition. Once unlocked, after you perform a component action (from action cards or technologies with ACTION: abilities), you can take ANOTHER action immediately. This allows for some crazy action card plays and lets you chain actions for big turns.

**Hero (depends on Tribunii choice):**

**Argent Flight - Overwing Zeta:** *Unlock: Have 3 scored objectives.*

**Artemiris Ascendant** - At the start of a round of space combat in a system that contains a planet you control: Place your flagship and up to a total of 2 cruisers and/or destroyers from your reinforcements in the active system. Then, purge this card.

Massive reinforcement. Instant flagship + 2 cruisers/destroyers in combat. Use when defending key systems or surprising opponents in critical battles.

**Mentak Coalition - Harka Leeds:** *Unlock: Have 3 scored objectives.*

**Erwan's Covenant** - ACTION: Reveal cards from the action deck until you reveal 3 action cards that have component actions. Draw those cards and shuffle the rest back into the action card deck. Then, purge this card.

Action card engine. Get 3 component action cards instantly. With Commander (Suffi An), these component actions let you take additional actions. Game-changing value.

**Xxcha Kingdom - Odlynn Myrr:** *Unlock: Have 3 scored objectives.*

**Operation Archon** - After an agenda is revealed: You may cast up to 6 additional votes on this agenda. Predict aloud an outcome of this agenda. For each player that votes for another outcome, gain 1 trade good and 1 command token. Then, purge this card.

Political pressure. Cast 6 extra votes on any agenda and predict the outcome. If others vote differently, you gain TG and command tokens. **Problem:** Players can simply abstain to deny you the rewards, making this the weakest of the three heroes.

### F. Promissory Note - **Keleres Rider**

After an agenda is revealed: You cannot vote on this agenda. Predict aloud an outcome of this agenda. If your prediction is correct, draw 1 action card and gain 2 trade goods. Then, return this card to the Keleres player.

Not worth much. The holder can't vote but gets to predict outcomes for rewards. **Best way to sell it:** 1 TG if used right away, or ask if someone wants to use it for free (you get the 2 TGs if they predict correctly, they get the free action card).

### G. Alliance

**Alliance Ability:**
*While you are neighbors with the Keleres player and their commander is unlocked:*
*After you perform a component action, you may perform an additional action.*

Useful alliance for action-heavy factions. Component actions let the ally chain additional actions. Good for making a friend and exchanging alliance promissory notes - your alliance doesn't have to be superb for them, but it helps you wash your commodities into trade goods through the trade relationship.

### H. Mech - **Omiopiares**

Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | **Sustain Damage**

Other players must spend 1 influence to commit ground forces to the planet that contains this unit.

Defensive mech. Opponents must spend 1 influence to invade planets with your mechs. **Important:** Each mech requires a separate influence payment. If you have multiple mechs on a planet, a 4-0 influence planet can only pay for one mech, not all of them. Not the most useful ability, but it can catch people off guard and make invasions awkward. Great for defending key planets like Mecatol Rex.

### I. Flagship - **Artemiris**

Cost: 8 | Combat: 7 (x2) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 3 | **Sustain Damage**

Other players must spend 2 influence to activate the system that contains this ship.

More annoying than great. Opponents must spend 2 influence to activate systems with your flagship, which can catch people off guard, but the stats are mediocre (7 combat x2, move 1). The influence tax is irritating but not game-breaking.

### J. Breakthrough - **I.I.H.Q. Modernization (Y<>G)**

When you gain this card, gain the Custodia Vigilia planet card and its legendary planet ability card. You are neighbours with all players that have units or control planets in or adjacent to the Mecatol Rex system.

**Custodia Vigilia:** 2 resources / 2 influence (Legendary Planet)

**Legendary Ability:** While you control Mecatol Rex, it gains SPACE CANNON 5 and PRODUCTION 3. Gain 2 command tokens when another player scores VP using Imperial.

**Y<>G Synergy:** Yellow and green technologies count as each other for prerequisites.

Really solid breakthrough that gives a value planet and allows for big lategame Mecatol Rex moves. Custodia Vigilia provides different value depending on the game state: when you control MR, it gives SPACE CANNON 5 and PRODUCTION 3 for defense and production; when you don't control MR, you still gain 2 command tokens whenever another player scores with Imperial. Combining the PRODUCTION 3 with your Agency Supply Network faction tech makes you very hard to push off Mecatol Rex - you can produce on MR and another system in a single action. Becoming neighbors with everyone near MR opens up diplomatic options.

**Y<>G synergy:** Opens yellow and green tech paths flexibly.

### K. Slice and Draft Considerations

Keleres wants flexibility and Mecatol Rex access. Your priorities:

**Speaker Order:**
- **Top 4 preferred** - You want early pick priority to avoid getting stuck with low-value strategy cards. Definitely want to avoid having to pick Warfare.

**Slice Priorities:**
- **Access to Mecatol Rex** - CRITICAL. Your entire strategy revolves around MR control. You need a clear path to MR. I.I.H.Q. Modernization makes you neighbors with everyone near MR, so getting close is essential.
- **Position for forward space dock** - A planet next to Mecatol Rex where you can build a forward space dock is extremely valuable. This helps you reach and defend MR more easily.
- **Legendary planets (Hope's End, Primor)** - Help solve your ground force problem (you only have 2 starting infantry).
- **High value low planet count systems nearby** - Check nearby systems for high value single-planet systems to smooth out your early game expansion - single-planet systems are easier to capture with limited infantry.
- **Flexible resources and influence** - You want both. Council Patronage gives you steady TG income, but you still need planets with both resources and influence for production and voting.

**Slice Features to Avoid:**
- **No access to Mecatol Rex** - You MUST be able to reach MR. Avoid isolated slices.
- **Extreme resource/influence imbalance** - You need both. Pure resource or pure influence slices limit your flexibility.

**Summary:**
Keleres needs Mecatol Rex access above all else. Choose your home system (Argent/Mentak/Xxcha) to match your slice's resource/influence distribution. Your I.I.H.Q. Modernization breakthrough makes MR control even more valuable—Custodia Vigilia buffs MR.

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

### A. First Turn Priorities

Your Round 1 (R1) is rough due to limited ground forces. The priority order is:

1. **Breakthrough Expedition** - Getting I.I.H.Q. Modernization (Y<>G) done early is very solid for value and peace of mind. You can unlock your breakthrough with your starting 2 commodities + 1 TG from Council Patronage (3 total), using your agent to spend commodities as trade goods. This lets you surprise the Trade holder and grab your breakthrough immediately using the Trade secondary.
2. **Expansion** - Poor. You only have 2 infantry, which severely limits your ability to take multiple planets R1. You'll struggle to expand beyond 2 systems. This can be solved with Construction primary (building structures with infantry) or Warfare secondary (redeploying units). Production is part of the same problem - you have a space dock and decent production capacity, but limited ground forces means you can't capitalize on it fully.
3. **Scoring** - Moderate. You can score some R1 objectives, but limited expansion hurts your scoring potential.
4. **Technology** - Good. You start with 2 techs of your choice, giving you flexibility to begin your tech path immediately.

Your ideal R1 involves expanding to 2 systems with your limited infantry and beginning your tech path.

### B. Home System Dependency

Your home system choice locks you into a specific economic profile. Choose poorly and you'll struggle all game. Mentak (4 resources) is best for resource-heavy slices, Xxcha (4 influence) for influence-heavy slices, Argent (2.5/2.5 optimal) for balanced slices. Choose wisely during setup—you can't change it.

### C. Mecatol Rex Dependence

Your entire strategy revolves around controlling Mecatol Rex. I.I.H.Q. Modernization buffs MR with SPACE CANNON 5 and PRODUCTION 3, making it incredibly valuable. If you can't reach MR or lose control of it, you lose a major advantage. Always prioritize MR access and defense.

---

## V. Technology

### A. Starting Technologies

You choose 2 non-faction techs owned by other players - this means you're limited to what your opponents have, not any 2 techs in the game. Your I.I.H.Q. Modernization breakthrough makes green and yellow count as each other for prerequisites, allowing green techs as well.

**Core Tech Goals:**
1. **Executive Order (Y)** - Draw and immediately vote on an agenda. Political control.
2. **Agency Supply Network (YY)** - Produce in two systems per action

**Recommended Starting Techs:**

Get **Sarween Tools (Y)** and a **blue tech** (preferably **Gravity Drive (BB)**, but **Dark Energy Tap (B)**, **Antimass Deflectors (B)**, or **Sling Relay (BB)** also work). Sarween gets you started on the yellow tech path toward Executive Order and Agency Supply Network. **Sarween has great synergy with Agency Supply Network** - when you produce in two systems per action, you get the -1 cost reduction in both systems, effectively getting double the discount. Gravity Drive gives you mobility to reach Mecatol Rex quickly. If Sarween isn't available, **Scanlink (Y)** is a fine replacement. **Predictive Intelligence (YY)** is also probably worth it as a yellow tech option.

**Green alternatives:** **Neural Motivator (G)** and **Bio-Stims (GG)** work with the Y<>G breakthrough - Neural lets you use your Commander (Suffi An) more with component action cards, Bio-Stims synergizes well with your faction tech Executive Order and is definitely a fun option. Bio-Stims + Executive Order allows for a potential of 10 extra agendas - who wouldn't love that?

**Last resort if there's truly no way to get to your blue/yellow path:** **AI Development Algorithm (R)**, **Self Assembly Routines (RR)**, or **Magen Defense Grid (RR)** can work, though these delay your core tech goals significantly.

### B. Tech Paths

**Primary Path:**

Assuming you found a way to start with yellow and blue (doesn't matter which):

**Round 1:**
- **Gravity Drive (BB)** if needed for expansion, otherwise skip tech R1

**Round 2:**
- **Executive Order (Y)** - You can now draw and vote on agendas whenever you want. This can be devastating - you force people to exhaust influence planets on agendas. Since you're always speaker when you use it, you can decide not to vote and use it purely as an economic advantage, exhausting opponents' influence planets while keeping yours fresh.

**Round 3:**
- **Agency Supply Network (YY)** - Once per action, when you resolve a unit's PRODUCTION ability, you may resolve another of your unit's PRODUCTION ability in any system. This means you can produce in two different systems in a single action. **Incredible production:** With Sarween Tools, you get the -1 discount in BOTH systems, effectively doubling your Sarween value. **Insane scaling:** With 3 space docks + Mecatol Rex (PRODUCTION 3), you can activate all 4 systems and produce up to 8 times total (4 activations × 2 productions per activation with ASN) - you can flood the board with units and reinforce multiple fronts simultaneously.

**Round 4-5:**
- **Carrier II (BB)**, **Dreadnought II (BBY)**, **Light/Wave Deflectors (BBBB)**, **Fleet Logistics (BBB)**, **Predictive Intelligence (YY)** - whatever you need

**Note:** I.I.H.Q. Modernization breakthrough swaps yellow/green prerequisites, so you can get green techs with yellow prereqs and vice versa.

### C. Notes

You have a straightforward and strong tech path that allows for multiple objectives, strong fighting, and good mobility. The Y<>G breakthrough flexibility means yellow and green techs count as each other for prerequisites, opening up additional tech options if needed.

---

## VI. Strategy Cards

### A. Round 1 Priority

1. **Construction** - Probably your top option. Get bonus space dock and solve early expansion problems (you only have 2 infantry).
2. **Trade** - Afford your Round 1-2 (R1-R2) tech research. The TG gives you flexibility.
3. **Technology** - Get started on your tech path early.
4. **Leadership** - Command tokens for expansion.
5. **Politics** - Solid. Speaker token and agenda control.
6. **Warfare** - Not great for you R1.
7. **Diplomacy** - Not a priority.
8. **Imperial** - Never R1.

For strategy token spending: Warfare secondary is critical (token spending part for producing infantry), Technology secondary to get expansion flex, Diplomacy secondary to afford to get all goodies R1.

### B. Round 2+

**Love:**
- **Politics** - Agenda control is your strength. Always value Politics.
- **Trade** - Need trade good income for Law's Order and economy.
- **Leadership** - Command tokens for production and expansion.
- **Imperial** - MR points when ready. Custodia Vigilia gives you 2 command tokens when others score Imperial—massive value.

**Good:**
- **Technology** - Staying on tech path.
- **Construction** - More structures for production scaling.

**Situational:**
- **Warfare** - If playing aggressively.
- **Diplomacy** - Depends on board state and diplomatic needs.

---

## VII. Intermediate

### A. Unit Composition

Your ideal fleet composition: **Carrier + Dreadnought + Fighter screen**. Never cruisers in fleet.

You'll have tons of infantry from production (thanks to Agency Supply Network and multiple space docks), so focus your fleet on carriers for capacity and dreadnoughts for combat power. Fighters absorb hits.

Deploy **mechs on key locations** (Omiopiares makes planets expensive to invade - opponents must spend 1 influence per mech).

**Flagship** is fine but build it more if objectives need it. It's not a core priority.

### B. Game Plan

**Round 1 is critical - solve your expansion problem to get economy started.** You have one of the highest ceilings but lowest floors on start. With only 2 infantry, you need to execute R1 carefully. Get Construction primary for a bonus space dock to expand, or use Warfare secondary to produce more ground forces. You can also get I.I.H.Q. Modernization breakthrough R1 using your starting commodities + Council Patronage TG (3 total) with your agent. This gives you Custodia Vigilia, which provides 2 command tokens when opponents score Imperial and makes you neighbors with everyone near Mecatol Rex, opening up diplomatic options. Solving your R1 expansion problem gives you the ability to execute your strategy further down the line.

**Take Mecatol Rex R3 or later** once you have your techs and armada set up. With Custodia Vigilia's PRODUCTION 3 and SPACE CANNON 5, MR becomes a fortress. The PRODUCTION 3 lets you produce on MR without a space dock, and combined with Agency Supply Network, you can reinforce MR and another system simultaneously.

**Use Executive Order aggressively** to screw with people's economy (force them to exhaust influence planets on agendas) or get valuable laws in play. Since you're always speaker when you use it, you can decide not to vote and use it purely as an economic weapon.

**Outproduce people with Agency Supply Network.** Once you have ASN and multiple space docks, you can flood the board with units. With 3 space docks + Mecatol Rex (PRODUCTION 3), you can produce up to 8 times total (4 activations × 2 productions per activation). This production advantage lets you maintain multiple fronts and replace losses easily.

**Use your mobility to hit objectives.** With Gravity Drive and your strong tech path, you have the mobility to grab objectives efficiently. Carrier II and Dreadnought II give you combat power and capacity to take and hold key systems.

**Fracture is available due to unit upgrades.** Your fleet of upgraded carriers and dreadnoughts can split and apply pressure across multiple fronts, making you hard to contain.

## IX. Alliance Priority

Trading for other factions' Alliance promissory notes (which give you access to their Commanders) can significantly boost your strategy. Here are the top alliances to prioritize:

**Top Tier:**
1. **Titans of Ul (Tungstantus)** - When you use PRODUCTION, gain 1 trade good. Insane synergy with ASN - up to 8 TG per round.
2. **Deepwrought (Aello)** - When others research tech, gain commodity/TG if they take -1 discount. Passive income and alliance tool.
3. **Vuil'raith Cabal (That Which Molds Flesh)** - When producing fighters/infantry, 2 don't count against PRODUCTION limit. Up to 16 extra units per round with ASN.
4. **Winnu (Rickar Rickani)** - Apply +2 combat in MR, home system, and legendary planet systems. Massive MR defense boost. Note: Unrealistic to get as both factions want Mecatol Rex.
5. **Nomad (Navarch Feng)** - Produce flagship without spending resources. Always good value.
6. **Crimson Rebellion (Ahk Siever)** - At the end of combat between any players, gain 1 commodity or convert 1 commodity to trade good. Passive income from any combat.

**Good:**
7. **Muaat (Magmus)** - After you spend strategy token, gain 1 trade good. Passive income from secondary spending.
8. **Nekro Virus (Nekro Acidos)** - After you gain tech, draw 1 action card. Turn tech path into action cards.
9. **Empyrean (Xuange)** - After another player moves ships into system with your token, return token to reinforcements. Ability to take back Mecatol Rex, or emergency pay someone to activate you and build again.
10. **Xxcha (Elder Qanoj)** - Each planet you exhaust to cast votes provides 1 additional vote. Increases your voting power.

## X. End Notes

Council Keleres is a top-tier faction that excels at winning from ahead. Solve your Round 1 (R1) expansion problem with Construction or Warfare secondary, get Executive Order R2 and Agency Supply Network R3 to unlock your insane production scaling, take Mecatol Rex R3 or later once you have your tech and armada setup, and use your production advantage to outproduce everyone and maintain multiple fronts simultaneously.

You control the political game through Executive Order (force opponents to exhaust influence on agendas), dominate economically with up to 8 productions per round once you have ASN, and turn every trade good into more units on the board. Your mobility lets you hit objectives efficiently, your production lets you maintain pressure everywhere, and your Mecatol Rex control gives you consistent VP. Play smart, convert all income into board presence, and demonstrate why you have one of the highest ceilings in the game.
