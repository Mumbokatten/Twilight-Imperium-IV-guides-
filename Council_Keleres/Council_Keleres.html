<h2 id="i.-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>The Council Keleres is TI4’s most adaptable faction, built around
choosing one of three sub-factions (Argent Flight, Mentak Coalition, or
Xxcha Kingdom) and inheriting their home system. This faction excels at
political manipulation, economic consistency, Mecatol Rex control, and
insane production capabilities. Keleres isn’t about raw power—it’s about
flexibility, agenda control, and leveraging political influence to shape
the game.</p>
<p>The payoff? Watching opponents realize you’ve controlled every agenda
that matters, seeing your economy stay consistent with Council
Patronage, producing on Mecatol Rex without a space dock thanks to
Custodia Vigilia, and using Agency Supply Network to produce in two
systems at once. When Keleres shows up, the galaxy bends to your
will.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-playstyle">II. Playstyle</h2>
<p>Playing Council Keleres is like commanding a top-tier political
powerhouse with military backup. Your Tribunii ability lets you choose
between three different home systems (Argent/Mentak/Xxcha), giving you
flexibility based on map position and strategy. Your Council Patronage
gives you free trade goods every round. Your Law’s Order lets you ignore
laws when needed.</p>
<p>The key strength of Keleres is adaptability and consistency. Choose
your home system wisely, leverage Council Patronage for steady economy,
and use Executive Order tech to control agendas. You win through
political dominance and strategic positioning. <strong>Keleres excels at
winning from ahead</strong> - once you get your faction techs (Executive
Order and Agency Supply Network), you become incredibly difficult to
stop.</p>
<p>Opponents will struggle to predict your moves. That moment when they
realize how many agendas they’ll have to vote for and start crying? Just
another day for Keleres.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iii.-the-basics">III. The Basics</h2>
<h3 id="a.-home-system-commodities">A. Home System &amp;
Commodities</h3>
<p><strong>Home System Options (choose one during setup):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Argent Flight:</strong> - <strong>Ylir:</strong> 0 resources
/ 2 influence - <strong>Valk:</strong> 2 resources / 0 influence -
<strong>Avar:</strong> 1 resource / 1 influence - <strong>Total: 3
resources / 3 influence (2.5 optimal resources / 2.5 optimal
influence)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mentak Coalition:</strong> - <strong>Mol Primus:</strong> 4
resources / 1 influence - <strong>Total: 4 resources / 1 influence (4
optimal resources / 0 optimal influence)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Xxcha Kingdom:</strong> - <strong>Archon Ren:</strong> 2
resources / 3 influence - <strong>Archon Tau:</strong> 1 resource / 1
influence - <strong>Total: 3 resources / 4 influence (0.5 optimal
resources / 3.5 optimal influence)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commodities:</strong> 2</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Your home system choice fundamentally changes
your economy and playstyle. <strong>Mentak is the clear #1
choice</strong> - one-planet home systems are far superior (easier to
defend), you get 4 resources (best for production), and Mentak hero
(Harka Leeds) is by far the best of the three, giving you 3 component
action cards that combo with your commander for extra actions. Always
pick Mentak if available.</p>
<p>Xxcha and Argent are a bit of a tossup. Multi-planet home systems are
rough - if you lose space combat, you’re defending multiple planets
which is nearly impossible (Xxcha has 2 planets, Argent has 3). Argent
has better total optimal value (2.5 + 2.5 = 5 optimal vs Xxcha’s 0.5 +
3.5 = 4 optimal) and a better hero (Overwing Zeta gives you instant
flagship + 2 cruisers/destroyers in combat), but both offer similar
influence.</p>
<h3 id="b.-starting-fleet">B. Starting Fleet</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 Carriers</li>
<li>1 Cruiser</li>
<li>2 Fighters</li>
<li>2 Infantry</li>
<li>1 Space Dock</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Rough starting fleet. While you have 2
carriers for capacity and a cruiser for combat, you only have 2
infantry, which greatly reduces your ability to expand early. You’ll
struggle to take multiple planets R1 compared to factions with more
ground forces. Plan your expansion carefully.</p>
<h3 id="c.-faction-abilities">C. Faction Abilities</h3>
<p><strong>The Tribunii:</strong> During setup, choose an unplayed
faction from among the Mentak, the Xxcha, and the Argent Flight; take
that faction’s home system, command tokens, and control markers.
Additionally, take the Keleres hero that corresponds to that
faction.</p>
<p>Your defining ability. Choose your home system and starting command
tokens from one of three factions. This also determines which hero you
get (each has different abilities). Choose wisely based on map position,
slice resources/influence, and strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Council Patronage:</strong> Replenish your commodities at the
start of the strategy phase, then gain 1 trade good.</p>
<p>Incredible economic consistency. Every strategy phase, you refresh
your 2 commodities AND gain 1 TG for free. This gives you 3 TG worth of
value every round (2 commodities + 1 TG). <strong>Important:</strong>
You need a trade partner to wash your commodities into trade goods -
don’t be reliant on your agent to do this. Make friends and establish
trade agreements so you can actually use your commodity value.</p>
<p><strong>Law’s Order:</strong> You may spend 1 Trade Good or Commodity
to treat all laws as blank until the end of the turn.</p>
<p>Ultimate law flexibility. Spend 1 TG/commodity to ignore ALL laws for
the entire turn. Use this strategically when laws would hurt you.</p>
<h3 id="d.-starting-and-faction-technologies">D. Starting and Faction
Technologies</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Technologies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Choose 2 non-faction technologies owned by other
players</strong></p>
<p><strong>Optimal:</strong> <strong>Sarween Tools</strong> +
<strong>Gravity Drive</strong></p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> You choose 2 non-faction techs owned by other
players - this means you’re limited to what your opponents have, not any
2 techs in the game. Sarween Tools gets you started on the yellow tech
path, and Gravity Drive gives you the mobility to reach Mecatol Rex
quickly. If these aren’t available from other players, take any blue +
yellow combination that is available. Your I.I.H.Q. Modernization
breakthrough makes green and yellow count as each other for
prerequisites, allowing green techs as well. See Section V (Technology)
for detailed discussion of starting tech options and tech paths.</p>
<p><strong>Faction Technologies:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Executive Order (Y):</strong> <em>ACTION: Draw and reveal 1
agenda card from the top of the agenda deck. Players may cast votes for
or against this agenda as if it were the outcome of an agenda. You are
the speaker for this agenda.</em></p>
<p>Your signature political control technology. Draw and vote on agendas
whenever you want - devastating for controlling the game. Force
opponents to exhaust influence planets on agendas. Since you’re always
speaker when you use it, you can decide not to vote and use it purely as
an economic weapon, exhausting opponents’ influence planets while
keeping yours fresh. High priority tech to get by Round 2.</p>
<p><strong>Agency Supply Network (YY):</strong> <em>Once per action,
when you resolve a unit’s PRODUCTION ability, you may resolve another of
your unit’s PRODUCTION ability in any system.</em></p>
<p>Game-changing production technology. Produce in two different systems
in a single action. With Sarween Tools, you get the -1 discount in BOTH
systems, effectively doubling your Sarween value. With 3 space docks +
Mecatol Rex (PRODUCTION 3 from Custodia Vigilia), you can activate all 4
systems and produce up to 8 times total (4 activations × 2 productions
per activation). This lets you flood the board with units and reinforce
multiple fronts simultaneously. Essential tech to get by Round 3.</p>
<h3 id="e.-leaders">E. Leaders</h3>
<p><strong>Agent - Xander Alexin Victori III:</strong> At any time: You
may exhaust this card to allow any player to spend commodities as if
they were trade goods.</p>
<p>Useful diplomatic tool. Convert anyone’s commodities to trade goods
instantly. Great for helping allies or yourself in critical moments.
Good for making deals.</p>
<p><strong>Commander - Suffi An:</strong> <em>Unlock: Spend 1 trade good
after you play an action card that has a component action.</em></p>
<p>After you perform a component action: You may perform an additional
action.</p>
<p>Fairly easy unlock condition. Once unlocked, after you perform a
component action (from action cards or technologies with ACTION:
abilities), you can take ANOTHER action immediately. This allows for
some crazy action card plays and lets you chain actions for big
turns.</p>
<p><strong>Hero (depends on Tribunii choice):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Argent Flight - Overwing Zeta:</strong> <em>Unlock: Have 3
scored objectives.</em></p>
<p><strong>Artemiris Ascendant</strong> - At the start of a round of
space combat in a system that contains a planet you control: Place your
flagship and up to a total of 2 cruisers and/or destroyers from your
reinforcements in the active system. Then, purge this card.</p>
<p>Massive reinforcement. Instant flagship + 2 cruisers/destroyers in
combat. Use when defending key systems or surprising opponents in
critical battles.</p>
<p><strong>Mentak Coalition - Harka Leeds:</strong> <em>Unlock: Have 3
scored objectives.</em></p>
<p><strong>Erwan’s Covenant</strong> - ACTION: Reveal cards from the
action deck until you reveal 3 action cards that have component actions.
Draw those cards and shuffle the rest back into the action card deck.
Then, purge this card.</p>
<p>Action card engine. Get 3 component action cards instantly. With
Commander (Suffi An), these component actions let you take additional
actions. Game-changing value.</p>
<p><strong>Xxcha Kingdom - Odlynn Myrr:</strong> <em>Unlock: Have 3
scored objectives.</em></p>
<p><strong>Operation Archon</strong> - After an agenda is revealed: You
may cast up to 6 additional votes on this agenda. Predict aloud an
outcome of this agenda. For each player that votes for another outcome,
gain 1 trade good and 1 command token. Then, purge this card.</p>
<p>Political pressure. Cast 6 extra votes on any agenda and predict the
outcome. If others vote differently, you gain TG and command tokens.
<strong>Problem:</strong> Players can simply abstain to deny you the
rewards, making this the weakest of the three heroes.</p>
<h3 id="f.-promissory-note---keleres-rider">F. Promissory Note -
<strong>Keleres Rider</strong></h3>
<p>After an agenda is revealed: You cannot vote on this agenda. Predict
aloud an outcome of this agenda. If your prediction is correct, draw 1
action card and gain 2 trade goods. Then, return this card to the
Keleres player.</p>
<p>Not worth much. The holder can’t vote but gets to predict outcomes
for rewards. <strong>Best way to sell it:</strong> 1 TG if used right
away, or ask if someone wants to use it for free (you get the 2 TGs if
they predict correctly, they get the free action card).</p>
<h3 id="g.-alliance">G. Alliance</h3>
<p><strong>Alliance Ability:</strong> <em>While you are neighbors with
the Keleres player and their commander is unlocked:</em> <em>After you
perform a component action, you may perform an additional
action.</em></p>
<p>Useful alliance for action-heavy factions. Component actions let the
ally chain additional actions. Good for making a friend and exchanging
alliance promissory notes - your alliance doesn’t have to be superb for
them, but it helps you wash your commodities into trade goods through
the trade relationship.</p>
<h3 id="h.-mech---omiopiares">H. Mech - <strong>Omiopiares</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | <strong>Sustain Damage</strong></p>
<p>Other players must spend 1 influence to commit ground forces to the
planet that contains this unit.</p>
<p>Defensive mech. Opponents must spend 1 influence to invade planets
with your mechs. <strong>Important:</strong> Each mech requires a
separate influence payment. If you have multiple mechs on a planet, a
4-0 influence planet can only pay for one mech, not all of them. Not the
most useful ability, but it can catch people off guard and make
invasions awkward. Great for defending key planets like Mecatol Rex.</p>
<h3 id="i.-flagship---artemiris">I. Flagship -
<strong>Artemiris</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 8 | Combat: 7 (x2) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 3 | <strong>Sustain
Damage</strong></p>
<p>Other players must spend 2 influence to activate the system that
contains this ship.</p>
<p>More annoying than great. Opponents must spend 2 influence to
activate systems with your flagship, which can catch people off guard,
but the stats are mediocre (7 combat x2, move 1). The influence tax is
irritating but not game-breaking.</p>
<h3 id="j.-breakthrough---i.i.h.q.-modernization-yg">J. Breakthrough -
<strong>I.I.H.Q. Modernization (Y&lt;&gt;G)</strong></h3>
<p>When you gain this card, gain the Custodia Vigilia planet card and
its legendary planet ability card. You are neighbours with all players
that have units or control planets in or adjacent to the Mecatol Rex
system.</p>
<p><strong>Custodia Vigilia:</strong> 2 resources / 2 influence
(Legendary Planet)</p>
<p><strong>Legendary Ability:</strong> While you control Mecatol Rex, it
gains SPACE CANNON 5 and PRODUCTION 3. Gain 2 command tokens when
another player scores VP using Imperial.</p>
<p><strong>Y&lt;&gt;G Synergy:</strong> Yellow and green technologies
count as each other for prerequisites.</p>
<p>Really solid breakthrough that gives a value planet and allows for
big lategame Mecatol Rex moves. Custodia Vigilia provides different
value depending on the game state: when you control MR, it gives SPACE
CANNON 5 and PRODUCTION 3 for defense and production; when you don’t
control MR, you still gain 2 command tokens whenever another player
scores with Imperial. Combining the PRODUCTION 3 with your Agency Supply
Network faction tech makes you very hard to push off Mecatol Rex - you
can produce on MR and another system in a single action. Becoming
neighbors with everyone near MR opens up diplomatic options.</p>
<p><strong>Y&lt;&gt;G synergy:</strong> Opens yellow and green tech
paths flexibly.</p>
<h3 id="k.-slice-and-draft-considerations">K. Slice and Draft
Considerations</h3>
<p>Keleres wants flexibility and Mecatol Rex access. Your
priorities:</p>
<p><strong>Speaker Order:</strong> - <strong>Top 4 preferred</strong> -
You want early pick priority to avoid getting stuck with low-value
strategy cards. Definitely want to avoid having to pick Warfare.</p>
<p><strong>Slice Priorities:</strong> - <strong>Access to Mecatol
Rex</strong> - CRITICAL. Your entire strategy revolves around MR
control. You need a clear path to MR. I.I.H.Q. Modernization makes you
neighbors with everyone near MR, so getting close is essential. -
<strong>Position for forward space dock</strong> - A planet next to
Mecatol Rex where you can build a forward space dock is extremely
valuable. This helps you reach and defend MR more easily. -
<strong>Legendary planets (Hope’s End, Primor)</strong> - Help solve
your ground force problem (you only have 2 starting infantry). -
<strong>High value low planet count systems nearby</strong> - Check
nearby systems for high value single-planet systems to smooth out your
early game expansion - single-planet systems are easier to capture with
limited infantry. - <strong>Flexible resources and influence</strong> -
You want both. Council Patronage gives you steady TG income, but you
still need planets with both resources and influence for production and
voting.</p>
<p><strong>Slice Features to Avoid:</strong> - <strong>No access to
Mecatol Rex</strong> - You MUST be able to reach MR. Avoid isolated
slices. - <strong>Extreme resource/influence imbalance</strong> - You
need both. Pure resource or pure influence slices limit your
flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Keleres needs Mecatol Rex access above all
else. Choose your home system (Argent/Mentak/Xxcha) to match your
slice’s resource/influence distribution. Your I.I.H.Q. Modernization
breakthrough makes MR control even more valuable—Custodia Vigilia buffs
MR.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iv.-structural-weaknesses">IV. Structural Weaknesses</h2>
<h3 id="a.-first-turn-priorities">A. First Turn Priorities</h3>
<p>Your Round 1 (R1) is rough due to limited ground forces. The priority
order is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Breakthrough Expedition</strong> - Getting I.I.H.Q.
Modernization (Y&lt;&gt;G) done early is very solid for value and peace
of mind. You can unlock your breakthrough with your starting 2
commodities + 1 TG from Council Patronage (3 total), using your agent to
spend commodities as trade goods. This lets you surprise the Trade
holder and grab your breakthrough immediately using the Trade
secondary.</li>
<li><strong>Expansion</strong> - Poor. You only have 2 infantry, which
severely limits your ability to take multiple planets R1. You’ll
struggle to expand beyond 2 systems. This can be solved with
Construction primary (building structures with infantry) or Warfare
secondary (redeploying units). Production is part of the same problem -
you have a space dock and decent production capacity, but limited ground
forces means you can’t capitalize on it fully.</li>
<li><strong>Scoring</strong> - Moderate. You can score some R1
objectives, but limited expansion hurts your scoring potential.</li>
<li><strong>Technology</strong> - Good. You start with 2 techs of your
choice, giving you flexibility to begin your tech path immediately.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your ideal R1 involves expanding to 2 systems with your limited
infantry and beginning your tech path.</p>
<h3 id="b.-home-system-dependency">B. Home System Dependency</h3>
<p>Your home system choice locks you into a specific economic profile.
Choose poorly and you’ll struggle all game. Mentak (4 resources) is best
for resource-heavy slices, Xxcha (4 influence) for influence-heavy
slices, Argent (2.5/2.5 optimal) for balanced slices. Choose wisely
during setup—you can’t change it.</p>
<h3 id="c.-mecatol-rex-dependence">C. Mecatol Rex Dependence</h3>
<p>Your entire strategy revolves around controlling Mecatol Rex.
I.I.H.Q. Modernization buffs MR with SPACE CANNON 5 and PRODUCTION 3,
making it incredibly valuable. If you can’t reach MR or lose control of
it, you lose a major advantage. Always prioritize MR access and
defense.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="v.-technology">V. Technology</h2>
<h3 id="a.-starting-technologies">A. Starting Technologies</h3>
<p>You choose 2 non-faction techs owned by other players - this means
you’re limited to what your opponents have, not any 2 techs in the game.
Your I.I.H.Q. Modernization breakthrough makes green and yellow count as
each other for prerequisites, allowing green techs as well.</p>
<p><strong>Core Tech Goals:</strong> 1. <strong>Executive Order
(Y)</strong> - Draw and immediately vote on an agenda. Political
control. 2. <strong>Agency Supply Network (YY)</strong> - Produce in two
systems per action</p>
<p><strong>Recommended Starting Techs:</strong></p>
<p>Get <strong>Sarween Tools</strong> and a <strong>blue tech</strong>
(preferably <strong>Gravity Drive (B)</strong>, but <strong>Dark Energy
Tap</strong>, <strong>Antimass Deflectors</strong>, or <strong>Sling
Relay (B)</strong> also work). Sarween gets you started on the yellow
tech path toward Executive Order and Agency Supply Network.
<strong>Sarween has great synergy with Agency Supply Network</strong> -
when you produce in two systems per action, you get the -1 cost
reduction in both systems, effectively getting double the discount.
Gravity Drive gives you mobility to reach Mecatol Rex quickly. If
Sarween isn’t available, <strong>Scanlink Drone Network</strong> is a
fine replacement. <strong>Predictive Intelligence (Y)</strong> is also
probably worth it as a yellow tech option.</p>
<p><strong>Green alternatives:</strong> <strong>Neural
Motivator</strong> and <strong>Bio-Stims (G)</strong> work with the
Y&lt;&gt;G breakthrough - Neural lets you use your Commander (Suffi An)
more with component action cards, Bio-Stims synergizes well with your
faction tech Executive Order and is definitely a fun option. Bio-Stims +
Executive Order allows for a potential of 10 extra agendas - who
wouldn’t love that?</p>
<p><strong>Last resort if there’s truly no way to get to your
blue/yellow path:</strong> <strong>AI Development Algorithm</strong>,
<strong>Self-Assembly Routines (R)</strong>, or <strong>Magen Defense
Grid (R)</strong> can work, though these delay your core tech goals
significantly.</p>
<h3 id="b.-tech-paths">B. Tech Paths</h3>
<p><strong>Primary Path:</strong></p>
<p>Assuming you found a way to start with yellow and blue (doesn’t
matter which):</p>
<p><strong>Round 1:</strong> - <strong>Gravity Drive (B)</strong> if
needed for expansion, otherwise skip tech R1</p>
<p><strong>Round 2:</strong> - <strong>Executive Order (Y)</strong> -
You can now draw and vote on agendas whenever you want. This can be
devastating - you force people to exhaust influence planets on agendas.
Since you’re always speaker when you use it, you can decide not to vote
and use it purely as an economic advantage, exhausting opponents’
influence planets while keeping yours fresh.</p>
<p><strong>Round 3:</strong> - <strong>Agency Supply Network
(YY)</strong> - Once per action, when you resolve a unit’s PRODUCTION
ability, you may resolve another of your unit’s PRODUCTION ability in
any system. This means you can produce in two different systems in a
single action. <strong>Incredible production:</strong> With Sarween
Tools, you get the -1 discount in BOTH systems, effectively doubling
your Sarween value. <strong>Insane scaling:</strong> With 3 space docks
+ Mecatol Rex (PRODUCTION 3), you can activate all 4 systems and produce
up to 8 times total (4 activations × 2 productions per activation with
ASN) - you can flood the board with units and reinforce multiple fronts
simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Round 4-5:</strong> - <strong>Carrier II (BB)</strong>,
<strong>Dreadnought II (BBY)</strong>, <strong>Light/Wave Deflectors
(BBBB)</strong>, <strong>Fleet Logistics (BBB)</strong>,
<strong>Predictive Intelligence (YY)</strong> - whatever you need</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I.I.H.Q. Modernization breakthrough swaps
yellow/green prerequisites, so you can get green techs with yellow
prereqs and vice versa.</p>
<h3 id="c.-notes">C. Notes</h3>
<p>You have a straightforward and strong tech path that allows for
multiple objectives, strong fighting, and good mobility. The Y&lt;&gt;G
breakthrough flexibility means yellow and green techs count as each
other for prerequisites, opening up additional tech options if
needed.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vi.-strategy-cards">VI. Strategy Cards</h2>
<h3 id="a.-round-1-priority">A. Round 1 Priority</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Construction</strong> - Probably your top option. Get bonus
space dock and solve early expansion problems (you only have 2
infantry).</li>
<li><strong>Trade</strong> - Afford your Round 1-2 (R1-R2) tech
research. The TG gives you flexibility.</li>
<li><strong>Technology</strong> - Get started on your tech path
early.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership</strong> - Command tokens for expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Politics</strong> - Solid. Speaker token and agenda
control.</li>
<li><strong>Warfare</strong> - Not great for you R1.</li>
<li><strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Not a priority.</li>
<li><strong>Imperial</strong> - Never R1.</li>
</ol>
<p>For strategy token spending: Warfare secondary is critical (token
spending part for producing infantry), Technology secondary to get
expansion flex, Diplomacy secondary to afford to get all goodies R1.</p>
<h3 id="b.-round-2">B. Round 2+</h3>
<p><strong>Love:</strong> - <strong>Politics</strong> - Agenda control
is your strength. Always value Politics. - <strong>Trade</strong> - Need
trade good income for Law’s Order and economy. -
<strong>Leadership</strong> - Command tokens for production and
expansion. - <strong>Imperial</strong> - MR points when ready. Custodia
Vigilia gives you 2 command tokens when others score Imperial—massive
value.</p>
<p><strong>Good:</strong> - <strong>Technology</strong> - Staying on
tech path. - <strong>Construction</strong> - More structures for
production scaling.</p>
<p><strong>Situational:</strong> - <strong>Warfare</strong> - If playing
aggressively. - <strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Depends on board state and
diplomatic needs.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vii.-intermediate">VII. Intermediate</h2>
<h3 id="a.-unit-composition">A. Unit Composition</h3>
<p>Your ideal fleet composition: <strong>Carrier + Dreadnought + Fighter
screen</strong>. Never cruisers in fleet.</p>
<p>You’ll have tons of infantry from production (thanks to Agency Supply
Network and multiple space docks), so focus your fleet on carriers for
capacity and dreadnoughts for combat power. Fighters absorb hits.</p>
<p>Deploy <strong>mechs on key locations</strong> (Omiopiares makes
planets expensive to invade - opponents must spend 1 influence per
mech).</p>
<p><strong>Flagship</strong> is fine but build it more if objectives
need it. It’s not a core priority.</p>
<h3 id="b.-game-plan">B. Game Plan</h3>
<p><strong>Round 1 is critical - solve your expansion problem to get
economy started.</strong> You have one of the highest ceilings but
lowest floors on start. With only 2 infantry, you need to execute R1
carefully. Get Construction primary for a bonus space dock to expand, or
use Warfare secondary to produce more ground forces. You can also get
I.I.H.Q. Modernization breakthrough R1 using your starting commodities +
Council Patronage TG (3 total) with your agent. This gives you Custodia
Vigilia, which provides 2 command tokens when opponents score Imperial
and makes you neighbors with everyone near Mecatol Rex, opening up
diplomatic options. Solving your R1 expansion problem gives you the
ability to execute your strategy further down the line.</p>
<p><strong>Take Mecatol Rex R3 or later</strong> once you have your
techs and armada set up. With Custodia Vigilia’s PRODUCTION 3 and SPACE
CANNON 5, MR becomes a fortress. The PRODUCTION 3 lets you produce on MR
without a space dock, and combined with Agency Supply Network, you can
reinforce MR and another system simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>Use Executive Order aggressively</strong> to screw with
people’s economy (force them to exhaust influence planets on agendas) or
get valuable laws in play. Since you’re always speaker when you use it,
you can decide not to vote and use it purely as an economic weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Outproduce people with Agency Supply Network.</strong> Once
you have ASN and multiple space docks, you can flood the board with
units. With 3 space docks + Mecatol Rex (PRODUCTION 3), you can produce
up to 8 times total (4 activations × 2 productions per activation). This
production advantage lets you maintain multiple fronts and replace
losses easily.</p>
<p><strong>Use your mobility to hit objectives.</strong> With Gravity
Drive and your strong tech path, you have the mobility to grab
objectives efficiently. Carrier II and Dreadnought II give you combat
power and capacity to take and hold key systems.</p>
<p><strong>Fracture is available due to unit upgrades.</strong> Your
fleet of upgraded carriers and dreadnoughts can split and apply pressure
across multiple fronts, making you hard to contain.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="viii.-objectives">VIII. Objectives</h2>
<h3 id="a.-objective-summary">A. Objective Summary</h3>
<p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Keleres excels at agenda and political
objectives with flexible voting power and Council Patronage economy.
Tech objectives are achievable with strong tech paths, and Mecatol Rex
scoring is natural with Custodia Vigilia production ability.</p>
<p><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Structure objectives are very difficult
without natural production bonuses. Tech diversity objectives can be
challenging depending on starting tech availability, and planet control
objectives require more work than combat-focused factions.</p>

<h2 id="ix.-alliance-priority">IX. Alliance Priority</h2>
<p>Trading for other factions’ Alliance promissory notes (which give you
access to their Commanders) can significantly boost your strategy. Here
are the top alliances to prioritize:</p>
<p><strong>Top Tier:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Titans of Ul (Tungstantus)</strong> - When you use
PRODUCTION, gain 1 trade good. Insane synergy with ASN - up to 8 TG per
round.</li>
<li><strong>Deepwrought (Aello)</strong> - When others research tech,
gain commodity/TG if they take -1 discount. Passive income and alliance
tool.</li>
<li><strong>Vuil’raith Cabal (That Which Molds Flesh)</strong> - When
producing fighters/infantry, 2 don’t count against PRODUCTION limit. Up
to 16 extra units per round with ASN.</li>
<li><strong>Winnu (Rickar Rickani)</strong> - Apply +2 combat in MR,
home system, and legendary planet systems. Massive MR defense boost.
Note: Unrealistic to get as both factions want Mecatol Rex.</li>
<li><strong>Nomad (Navarch Feng)</strong> - Produce flagship without
spending resources. Always good value.</li>
<li><strong>Crimson Rebellion (Ahk Siever)</strong> - At the end of
combat between any players, gain 1 commodity or convert 1 commodity to
trade good. Passive income from any combat.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Good:</strong></p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><strong>Muaat (Magmus)</strong> - After you spend strategy token,
gain 1 trade good. Passive income from secondary spending.</li>
<li><strong>Nekro Virus (Nekro Acidos)</strong> - After you gain tech,
draw 1 action card. Turn tech path into action cards.</li>
<li><strong>Empyrean (Xuange)</strong> - After another player moves
ships into system with your token, return token to reinforcements.
Ability to take back Mecatol Rex, or emergency pay someone to activate
you and build again.</li>
<li><strong>Xxcha (Elder Qanoj)</strong> - Each planet you exhaust to
cast votes provides 1 additional vote. Increases your voting power.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="x.-bonus-game-elements">X. Bonus Game Elements</h2>
<p>This section highlights action cards that synergize particularly well
with your faction’s strengths or mitigate your weaknesses, relics that
offer exceptional value for your faction’s strategy and abilities, and
agendas to pursue that benefit your position, and agendas to watch out
for that could hurt you.</p>
<h3 id="a.-high-value-action-cards">A. High-Value Action Cards</h3>
<h3 id="b.-relic-priorities">B. Relic Priorities</h3>
<h3 id="c.-agenda-awareness">C. Agenda Awareness</h3>
<hr />
<h2 id="xi.-end-notes">XI. End Notes</h2>
<p>Council Keleres is a top-tier faction that excels at winning from
ahead. Solve your Round 1 (R1) expansion problem with Construction or
Warfare secondary, get Executive Order R2 and Agency Supply Network R3
to unlock your insane production scaling, take Mecatol Rex R3 or later
once you have your tech and armada setup, and use your production
advantage to outproduce everyone and maintain multiple fronts
simultaneously.</p>
<p>You control the political game through Executive Order (force
opponents to exhaust influence on agendas), dominate economically with
up to 8 productions per round once you have ASN, and turn every trade
good into more units on the board. Your mobility lets you hit objectives
efficiently, your production lets you maintain pressure everywhere, and
your Mecatol Rex control gives you consistent VP. Play smart, convert
all income into board presence, and demonstrate why you have one of the
highest ceilings in the game.</p>
