<h2 id="i.-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>The Barony of Letnev is the strongest fighting faction in TI4. This
faction excels at building massive armadas of capital ships, controlling
space through sheer naval superiority, and grinding opponents down in
prolonged space combat. Letnev isn’t about finesse—it’s about
overwhelming firepower and fleet capacity that other factions simply
can’t match.</p>
<p>The payoff? Watching opponents realize they can’t contest your
5-dreadnought deathball, seeing their fleets crumble under sustained
rerolls from Munitions Reserves, and dominating every space battle
through superior fleet composition. When Letnev shows up, space combat
becomes a foregone conclusion.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-playstyle">II. Playstyle</h2>
<p>Playing Barony of Letnev is about having more ships than opponents
expect. Your Armada ability lets you field 2 more non-fighter ships than
your fleet pool limit in every system. Your Munitions Reserves lets you
spend 2 trade goods to reroll dice in space combat, ensuring consistent
damage output.</p>
<p>The key strength of Letnev is fleet superiority. Build expensive
capital ships (dreadnoughts, cruisers, carriers), leverage your expanded
fleet capacity to outnumber opponents, and use combat rerolls to
guarantee victories.</p>
<p>Opponents will fear engaging your fleets. That moment when they count
your ships and realize you have 2 more than they thought possible? Pure
dominance.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iii.-the-basics">III. The Basics</h2>
<h3 id="a.-home-system-commodities">A. Home System &amp;
Commodities</h3>
<p><strong>Home System:</strong> - <strong>Arc Prime:</strong> 4
resources / 0 influence = 4 optimal resources - <strong>Wren
Terra:</strong> 2 resources / 1 influence = 2 optimal resources -
<strong>Total: 6 resources / 1 influence (6 optimal resources / 0
optimal influence)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commodities:</strong> 2</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Incredibly resource-heavy home system (6
resources!) with almost no influence. This is perfect for Letnev’s
expensive fleet production but makes you weak politically. The 2-planet
home system is easier to defend than 3-planet systems.</p>
<h3 id="b.-starting-fleet">B. Starting Fleet</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 Dreadnought</li>
<li>1 Carrier</li>
<li>1 Destroyer</li>
<li>1 Fighter</li>
<li>3 Infantry</li>
<li>1 Space Dock</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Decent starting fleet with a dreadnought for
early combat power. The variety of ships (dread, carrier, destroyer)
gives you flexibility for R1 expansion. Only 3 infantry limits your
ground force options early.</p>
<h3 id="c.-starting-technologies">C. Starting Technologies</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Antimass Deflectors (Blue)</strong> - Your ships can move
into and through asteroid fields. When other players’ units use SPACE
CANNON against your units, apply -1 to the result of each die roll.</li>
<li><strong>Plasma Scoring (Red)</strong> - When 1 or more of your units
use BOMBARDMENT or SPACE CANNON, 1 of those units may roll 1 additional
die.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Blue and red starting techs open multiple
tech paths. Antimass helps with mobility through asteroids, Plasma
Scoring boosts your BOMBARDMENT (important for dreadnought-heavy
builds).</p>
<h3 id="d.-faction-abilities">D. Faction Abilities</h3>
<p><strong>Munitions Reserves:</strong> At the start of each round of
space combat, you may spend 2 trade goods; you may reroll any number of
your dice during that combat round.</p>
<p>Incredible combat ability. Spending 2 TG to reroll ALL your dice in a
combat round dramatically increases hit consistency. With large fleets,
this is devastating—imagine rerolling 5 dreadnought shots. You need
trade good income to fuel this.</p>
<p><strong>Armada:</strong> The maximum number of non-fighter ships you
can have in each system is equal to 2 more than the number of tokens in
your fleet pool.</p>
<p>Your signature ability. If you have 3 fleet pool tokens, you can have
5 non-fighter ships per system instead of 3. This lets you build
absolutely massive capital ship fleets that no one else can
match—dreadnought armadas that dominate every system. Fighters still
count against capacity, but capital ships get +2 headroom.</p>
<h3 id="e.-leaders">E. Leaders</h3>
<p><strong>Agent - Viscount Unlenn:</strong> At the start of a space
combat round: You may exhaust this card to choose 1 ship in the active
system; that ship rolls 1 additional die during this combat round.</p>
<p>Useful for boosting a flagship or war sun’s combat rolls. Solid
combat support agent.</p>
<p><strong>Commander - Rear Admiral Farran:</strong> <em>Unlock: Have 5
non-fighter ships in 1 system.</em></p>
<p>After 1 of your units uses Sustain Damage: You may gain 1 trade
good.</p>
<p>Easy unlock for Letnev (5 non-fighter ships). Generates trade goods
when you use Sustain Damage, which fuels Munitions Reserves. Excellent
synergy—your capital ships take hits, you get TG, you spend TG on
rerolls. You literally make money from fighting. Economic engine that
rewards combat aggression.</p>
<p><strong>Hero - Darktalon Treilla:</strong> <em>Unlock: Have 3 scored
objectives.</em></p>
<p><strong>Dark Matter Affinity</strong> - ACTION: Place this card near
the game board; the number of non-fighter ships you can have in systems
is not limited by laws or by the number of command tokens in your fleet
pool during this game round. At the end of that game round, purge this
card.</p>
<p>Massive repositioning tool. For one round, you ignore fleet limits
entirely—build the biggest fleet imaginable and move it wherever you
want. Use for critical MR push or final assault. Save for R4-R5 when it
wins the game.</p>
<h3 id="f.-promissory-note---war-funding">F. Promissory Note -
<strong>War Funding</strong></h3>
<p>After you and your opponent roll dice during space combat: You may
reroll all of your opponent’s dice. You may reroll any number of your
dice. Then, return this card to the Letnev player.</p>
<p>Strong combat PN. Reroll your own dice AND your opponent’s dice in
combat. Trade value: 2-3 TG. Like Argent’s PN, try to sell to active
player so it gets used and returned quickly.</p>
<h3 id="g.-alliance">G. Alliance</h3>
<p><strong>Alliance Ability:</strong> <em>While the Letnev player’s
commander is unlocked:</em> <em>After 1 of your units uses Sustain
Damage, you may gain 1 trade good.</em></p>
<p>Excellent economic alliance for factions with capital ships.
Generates trade goods from combat, which can fuel various abilities.
Very strong for sustained combat factions. Trade value: 3-4 TG.</p>
<h3 id="h.-mech---dunlain-reaper">H. Mech - <strong>Dunlain
Reaper</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | <strong>Sustain Damage</strong></p>
<p><strong>DEPLOY:</strong> At the start of a round of ground combat,
you may spend 2 resources to replace 1 of your infantry in that combat
with 1 mech.</p>
<p>Expensive but can be deployed pre-combat by spending 2 resources.
Good for surprise ground combat swings. Sustain Damage makes it
durable.</p>
<p><strong>With Duranium Armor + Non-Euclidean Shielding:</strong> Your
mechs become monsters. Non-Euclidean Shielding makes them cancel 2 hits
instead of 1 when using Sustain Damage, and Duranium Armor repairs 1
damaged unit each combat round. Your mechs are only rivaled by
Naaz-Rokha Alliance mechs—effectively unkillable in ground combat.</p>
<h3 id="i.-flagship---arc-secundus">I. Flagship - <strong>Arc
Secundus</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 8 | Combat: 5 (x2) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 3 | <strong>Sustain
Damage</strong> | <strong>BOMBARDMENT 5 (x3)</strong></p>
<p>Other players’ units in this system lose Planetary Shield. At the
start of each space combat round, repair this ship.</p>
<p>Incredible flagship. Removes Planetary Shield from enemies (lets your
BOMBARDMENT through), and repairs itself every combat round. Effectively
has infinite Sustain Damage in prolonged fights. With BOMBARDMENT 5
(x3), it shreds ground forces. Essential for late game dominance.</p>
<h3 id="j.-breakthrough---gravleash-maneuvers-br">J. Breakthrough -
<strong>Gravleash Maneuvers (B&lt;&gt;R)</strong></h3>
<p>Before you roll dice during space combat, apply +X to the results of
1 of your ship’s rolls, where X is the number of ship types you have in
the combat. During movement, your non-fighter ships’ move values are
equal to the highest move value amongst moving ships in the system they
started in.</p>
<p><strong>B&lt;&gt;R Synergy:</strong> Blue and red technologies count
as each other for prerequisites.</p>
<p><strong>Movement ability - Great substitute for early Gravity
Drive:</strong> Your slow dreadnoughts and carriers can move with your
faster destroyer. If you send your destroyer (move 2) with your carrier
(move 1) and dreadnought (move 1), all ships move 2 because the
destroyer has the highest move value. This solves a lot of slice
mobility issues early game—you don’t need Gravity Drive when you have
this breakthrough. Excellent for fleet mobility and reaching distant
planets R1.</p>
<p><strong>Breakthrough + Gravity Drive = ZOOMING:</strong> When you
eventually get Gravity Drive, your breakthrough becomes even more
powerful. Gravity Drive gives +1 move to one ship (making your destroyer
move 3), and Gravleash Maneuvers makes ALL your non-fighter ships move
3. Your entire fleet—dreadnoughts, carriers, flagship—can move 3 steps
together. Incredible late-game mobility.</p>
<p><strong>Combat bonus:</strong> Each ship type gives +1 to one roll.
With 5 ship types (carrier, dread, cruiser, destroyer, flagship), you
get +5 to one combat roll—almost guaranteed hit.</p>
<p><strong>B&lt;&gt;R synergy:</strong> Opens blue and red tech paths
flexibly.</p>
<h3 id="k.-slice-and-draft-considerations">K. Slice and Draft
Considerations</h3>
<p>Letnev wants resources and access to objectives. Your priorities:</p>
<p><strong>Speaker Order:</strong> - <strong>Prefer early positions
(1-3)</strong> - Lets you grab Trade and Leadership early to fuel your
expensive fleet buildup. - <strong>Target weak neighbors</strong> -
Position yourself next to factions you can pressure with superior
fleets.</p>
<p><strong>Slice Priorities:</strong> - <strong>Access to Fracture or
Mecatol Rex</strong> - CRITICAL. You need a path to score points through
controlling key objectives or legendary planets. - <strong>Prefer
influence over resources</strong> - Your home system has 6 resources
already, so you prefer more influence in your slice for more balance and
flexibility. Even though you have an expensive fleet, you’re already set
on resources. - <strong>Favor having 1-2 tech skips</strong> - Tech
skips help with Fracture plays. Your tech path works with B&lt;&gt;R
synergy from Gravleash Maneuvers, so you’re flexible.</p>
<p><strong>Slice Features to Avoid:</strong> - <strong>No access to
Fracture or Mecatol Rex</strong> - Makes scoring difficult. Avoid if
possible. - <strong>Low planet count with scattered systems</strong> -
Makes it hard to generate enough resources for constant production.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Letnev needs access to Fracture or Mecatol
Rex for scoring, high resources for fleet production, and influence
planets for economy. Your tech path is perfect without skips thanks to
B&lt;&gt;R synergy.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Note:</strong> Better to go for neutral objectives
(Fracture, Mecatol Rex) than fighting enemies. Although you’re the
strongest fighting faction, it’s hard to fight multiple opponents—focus
on objectives rather than meaningless aggression.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iv.-structural-weaknesses">IV. Structural Weaknesses</h2>
<h3 id="a.-first-turn-priorities">A. First Turn Priorities</h3>
<p>Your R1 priority order: <strong>Breakthrough &gt; Scoring &gt;
Production &gt; Tech</strong></p>
<p>Focus on: 1. <strong>Breakthrough (Gravleash Maneuvers)</strong> -
MUST GET. This is essential for your fleet mobility and combat power.
Top priority. 2. <strong>Scoring</strong> - Expand to score your R1
Stage I objective early. 3. <strong>Production</strong> - Build ships to
allow for more expansion. 4. <strong>Technology</strong> - Fourth
priority. Your tech path is slimmed so not a disaster to skip tech round
1.</p>
<p>With your strong home system (6 resources), you can try to go for all
of these R1 if possible. But if you have to choose, prioritize
Breakthrough first, then Scoring, then Production, then Tech.</p>
<p><strong>Expansion Notes:</strong> You have 1 dreadnought, 1 carrier,
1 destroyer, and only 3 infantry. Your dreadnought is slow (move 1), and
limited infantry means some slices can be problematic for expansion—you
may struggle to hold multiple planets without sufficient ground forces.
Focus on taking 2-3 nearby systems R1. Your strong combat power deters
early aggression, but plan your expansion carefully around your infantry
limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy Token Priority:</strong> If you have extra strategy
tokens, prioritize: Diplomacy, Warfare (if no Warfare in play, then
Tech)</p>
<h3 id="b.-economy-dependence">B. Economy Dependence</h3>
<p>Letnev has expensive abilities and low commodity value. Your
Munitions Reserves costs 2 trade goods per combat round, but you only
have 2 commodities—making trade good economy critical. Your scary board
presence might make diplomacy hard, as other factions may be reluctant
to trade with the strongest fighting faction—or easy (extortion). You
need: - Trade agreements to generate trade goods (you only have 2
commodities, need more income) - Commander unlock ASAP for Sustain
Damage → TG economy to fuel Munitions Reserves</p>
<h3 id="c.-political-weakness">C. Political Weakness</h3>
<p>1 influence at home. You have almost no voting power. Accept that you
won’t win political agendas—focus on military dominance instead.</p>
<p>However, being the strongest fighting faction makes you a threat to
everyone. This can make it hard to make good deals—players are less
willing to trade with or help the faction that could crush them
militarily. Your intimidating presence cuts both ways: feared in combat,
but isolated diplomatically.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="v.-technology">V. Technology</h2>
<h3 id="a.-overview">A. Overview</h3>
<p>You start with <strong>Antimass Deflectors (B)</strong> and
<strong>Plasma Scoring (R)</strong>.</p>
<p>Your main tech path focuses on: 1. <strong>Gravity Drive (B)</strong>
- Essential for mobility 2. <strong>Destroyer II (RR) and Non-Euclidean
Shielding (RR)</strong> - Upgraded destroyers and double Sustain Damage
on all units 3. <strong>Fleet Logistics and Lightwave Deflector</strong>
- Late game mobility and defense</p>
<h3 id="b.-tech-path">B. Tech Path</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Tech:</strong> Antimass Deflectors (B) + Plasma
Scoring (R)</p>
<p><strong>Round 1: Gravity Drive (B)</strong> - After you activate a
system, apply +1 to the move value of 1 of your ships during this
tactical action. - <strong>Why:</strong> ESSENTIAL. Combos with your
Gravleash Maneuvers breakthrough to give your entire fleet move 3. Your
destroyer becomes move 3 (2+1), and all your non-fighter ships move 3
with it. Must-have tech. - <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 1 blue
(Antimass Deflectors)</p>
<p><strong>Round 2: Destroyer II (RR)</strong> - Cost: 1 | Combat: 8 |
Move: 2 | ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE 6 (x3) - <strong>Why:</strong> Better
destroyers with improved combat (8 instead of 9) and devastating
ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE. Critical for your fleet composition. -
<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 2 red (Plasma Scoring + Gravity Drive
counts as red with B&lt;&gt;R synergy)</p>
<p><strong>Round 3: Non-Euclidean Shielding (RR)</strong> - When one of
your units uses Sustain Damage, cancel 2 hits instead of 1. -
<strong>Why:</strong> Your signature faction tech. Dreadnoughts,
carriers, flagship—all take 2 hits to damage instead of 1. Makes your
fleets incredibly durable. - <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 2 red
(Plasma Scoring + Destroyer II or Gravity Drive)</p>
<p><strong>Round 4: Duranium Armor (RR)</strong> - During each combat
round, after you assign hits to your units, repair 1 of your damaged
units that did not use Sustain Damage during this combat round. -
<strong>Why:</strong> Repairs a ship each combat round. Stacks with
Non-Euclidean Shielding for nearly unkillable fleets. -
<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 2 red (any two red techs you already
have)</p>
<p><strong>Round 5+:</strong> Flex techs based on objectives and game
state</p>
<h3 id="c.-flex-techs">C. Flex Techs</h3>
<p><strong>Carrier II (BB) - For Unit Upgrade Objectives:</strong> -
Cost: 3 | Combat: 9 | Move: 2 | Capacity: 6 - <strong>Why:</strong> If
you need a 2nd unit upgrade for “Develop Weaponry” objective (2 unit
upgrade technologies), Carrier II works fine. The extra capacity is
useful. - <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> 2 blue (Antimass + Gravity
Drive)</p>
<p><strong>Note on Dreadnought II:</strong> Not recommended. The extra
movement on dreadnoughts (move 2 instead of move 1) is not helpful with
Gravleash Maneuvers breakthrough—your breakthrough already makes
dreadnoughts move at the same speed as your destroyer (move 2, or move 3
with Gravity Drive). Skip Dreadnought II.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vi.-strategy-cards">VI. Strategy Cards</h2>
<h3 id="a.-round-1-priority">A. Round 1 Priority</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Trade</strong> - You have 2 commodities and need economy for
your expensive abilities</li>
<li><strong>Leadership</strong> - Command tokens for production and
expansion</li>
<li><strong>Politics</strong> - For breakthrough exploration.
Breakthrough is key.</li>
<li><strong>Technology</strong> - Pay 5 resources for expedition, save 4
resources from skipping secondary. Get started on tech path.</li>
<li><strong>Diplomacy</strong> - For breakthrough exploration if
Politics doesn’t get it. Breakthrough is key.</li>
<li><strong>Construction</strong> - Double dock at home (build 2nd space
dock in home system)</li>
<li><strong>Warfare</strong> - Redeploy + free activation</li>
<li><strong>Imperial</strong> - Never R1</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="b.-round-2-priority">B. Round 2+ Priority</h3>
<p><strong>Love:</strong> - <strong>Leadership</strong> - Command tokens
for fleet spam and production - <strong>Trade</strong> - Need trade good
income for Munitions Reserves. Economy balance.</p>
<p><strong>Like:</strong> - <strong>Technology</strong> - Staying on
tech path. Allows for easy double tech to make scary techs come earlier.
- <strong>Imperial</strong> - Needed once when on Mecatol Rex -
<strong>Politics</strong> - Agenda control -
<strong>Construction</strong> - Good until you have no space docks left
to build</p>
<p><strong>Situational:</strong> - <strong>Warfare</strong> - Only if
playing very aggressively. Anti-synergy: moving tokens from fleet pool
reduces Armada capacity (you get +2 ships per fleet token). Also
conflicts with Hero ability that ignores fleet limits. -
<strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Rarely useful</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vii.-intermediate">VII. Intermediate</h2>
<h3 id="a.-unit-composition">A. Unit Composition</h3>
<p>Your ideal fleet composition in each system:</p>
<p><strong>Minimum core:</strong> - <strong>1 Destroyer</strong> - For
Gravleash movement bonus and screening - <strong>1 Carrier</strong> -
For capacity - <strong>1 Dreadnought</strong> - For combat power and
Sustain Damage</p>
<p><strong>Then add as needed:</strong> - <strong>Flagship</strong> -
Strong flagship for critical systems - <strong>Fighters</strong> -
Absorb hits - <strong>Infantry</strong> - Ground forces -
<strong>Mechs</strong> - Deploy when needed using DEPLOY ability (spend
2 resources to replace infantry mid-combat)</p>
<p>Build up your capital ship count with Armada. With 3 fleet pool
tokens, you can have 5 non-fighter ships per system instead of 3. Fill
those extra slots with more dreadnoughts as your economy allows.</p>
<h3 id="b.-game-plan">B. Game Plan</h3>
<p><strong>Focus on Neutral Objectives, Not Aggression:</strong></p>
<p>Although you’re the strongest fighting faction in TI4, it’s better to
go for neutral objectives (Fracture, Mecatol Rex) than fighting enemies.
You’re strong in 1v1 combat, but it’s hard to fight multiple
opponents—players will gang up on you if you’re too aggressive. Focus on
objectives rather than conquest.</p>
<p><strong>Fracture Strategy:</strong></p>
<p>Getting relics in Fracture should be free for Letnev. Your superior
fleet can easily take and hold Fracture without much resistance. With
Gravleash Maneuvers breakthrough + Gravity Drive, your entire fleet can
move 3 steps, giving you incredible reach to Fracture. Use this mobility
to claim relics and legendary planets for easy points.</p>
<p><strong>Mecatol Rex Control:</strong></p>
<p>Your massive fleets (thanks to Armada) and combat superiority make
you the best faction for holding Mecatol Rex. Park a 5-dreadnought fleet
on MR, take Imperial when you control it, and score those MR points.
Your Non-Euclidean Shielding and Duranium Armor make it nearly
impossible to dislodge you once established.</p>
<p><strong>Styx Easy Access:</strong></p>
<p>With your move 3 fleet (Gravleash + Gravity Drive), Styx is an easy
point to access. Your mobility lets you reach distant legendary planets
that other factions struggle to get to. Free points from hard-to-reach
objectives.</p>

<h2 id="ix.-alliance-priority">IX. Alliance Priority</h2>
<p>Trading for other factions’ Alliance promissory notes (which give you
access to their Commanders) can significantly boost your strategy. Here
are the top alliances to prioritize:</p>
<p><strong>Super Top Tier:</strong> 1. <strong>Jol-Nar (Ta
Zern)</strong> - Reroll dice for unit abilities. Reroll BOMBARDMENT,
SPACE CANNON. Excellent for your flagship and dreadnoughts. 2.
<strong>Ghosts of Creuss (2RAM)</strong> - Units that have Planetary
Shield do not prevent you from using BOMBARDMENT. Top tier for
invasion-focused Letnev. Your dreadnoughts have BOMBARDMENT 5—bypass
Planetary Shield entirely. 3. <strong>Winnu (Rickar Rickani)</strong> -
+2 combat in MR, your home system, and legendary systems. Makes you
unstoppable on Mecatol Rex. You probably won’t get this alliance without
a ceasefire—Winnu knows how powerful this is for you. 4. <strong>Nomad
(Navarch Feng)</strong> - Produce flagship without spending resources.
Always good value. Saves 8 resources for dreadnought production. 5.
<strong>Muaat (Magmus)</strong> - After you spend strategy token, gain 1
trade good. Very good for generating TG income to fuel Munitions
Reserves.</p>
<p><strong>Really Useful:</strong> 6. <strong>Titans of Ul
(Tungstantus)</strong> - When you use PRODUCTION, gain 1 trade good.
Useful for constant TG income, but not critical. 7. <strong>Naaz-Rokha
(Dart and Tai)</strong> - After you gain control of a planet that was
controlled by another player, you may explore that planet. Useful for
conquest plays. 8. <strong>Nekro Virus (Nekro Acidos)</strong> - After
you gain a technology, you may draw 1 action card. Useful for building
action card hand while progressing your tech path. 9. <strong>Mentak
Coalition (S’ula Mentarion)</strong> - After you win a space combat, you
may force your opponent to give you 1 promissory note from their hand.
You win lots of space combat—steal PNs to get alliances you need.</p>

<h2 id="x.-end-notes">X. End Notes</h2>
<p>Barony of Letnev is the strongest fighting faction in TI4 with
unmatched fleet dominance. Your job is to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Get Gravleash Maneuvers breakthrough R1</strong> - MUST GET.
Enables fleet mobility and B&lt;&gt;R tech synergy</li>
<li><strong>Build effective fleets</strong> - Different ship types, high
movement, and strong power. Leverage Armada for 2 extra non-fighter
ships per system</li>
<li><strong>Leverage strong techs in ground and space combat</strong> -
Your tech path gives you powerful advantages</li>
<li><strong>Unlock Commander ASAP</strong> - Sustain Damage → TG economy
(make money from fighting)</li>
<li><strong>Make a few daring plays early</strong> - You need it to keep
up in economy</li>
<li><strong>Focus on neutral objectives</strong> - Go for Fracture and
Mecatol Rex rather than fighting enemies</li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t let anyone contest your naval superiority. You’re the strongest
fighting faction in TI4. Build dreadnoughts, reroll combat dice, and
dominate through overwhelming firepower—<strong>laughing
maniacally</strong>.</p>
