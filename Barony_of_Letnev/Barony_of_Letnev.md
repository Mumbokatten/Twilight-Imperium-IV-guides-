# Barony of Letnev Guide

![Barony of Letnev](BaronyArt.webp)

---

## I. Introduction

The Barony of Letnev is the strongest fighting faction in TI4. This faction excels at building massive armadas of capital ships, controlling space through sheer naval superiority, and grinding opponents down in prolonged space combat. Letnev isn't about finesse—it's about overwhelming firepower and fleet capacity that other factions simply can't match.

The payoff? Watching opponents realize they can't contest your 5-dreadnought deathball, seeing their fleets crumble under sustained rerolls from Munitions Reserves, and dominating every space battle through superior fleet composition. When Letnev shows up, space combat becomes a foregone conclusion.

## II. Playstyle

Playing Barony of Letnev is about having more ships than opponents expect. Your Armada ability lets you field 2 more non-fighter ships than your fleet pool limit in every system. Your Munitions Reserves lets you spend 2 trade goods to reroll dice in space combat, ensuring consistent damage output.

The key strength of Letnev is fleet superiority. Build expensive capital ships (dreadnoughts, cruisers, carriers), leverage your expanded fleet capacity to outnumber opponents, and use combat rerolls to guarantee victories.

Opponents will fear engaging your fleets. That moment when they count your ships and realize you have 2 more than they thought possible? Pure dominance.

## III. The Basics

### A. Home System & Commodities

**Home System:**
- **Arc Prime:** 4 resources / 0 influence = 4 optimal resources
- **Wren Terra:** 2 resources / 1 influence = 2 optimal resources
- **Total: 6 resources / 1 influence (6 optimal resources / 0 optimal influence)**

**Commodities:** 2

**Notes:** Incredibly resource-heavy home system (6 resources!) with almost no influence. This is perfect for Letnev's expensive fleet production but makes you weak politically. The 2-planet home system is easier to defend than 3-planet systems.

### B. Starting Fleet

- 1 Dreadnought
- 1 Carrier
- 1 Destroyer
- 1 Fighter
- 3 Infantry
- 1 Space Dock

**Notes:** Decent starting fleet with a dreadnought for early combat power. The variety of ships (dread, carrier, destroyer) gives you flexibility for R1 expansion. Only 3 infantry limits your ground force options early.

### C. Starting Technologies

- **Antimass Deflectors (Blue)** - Your ships can move into and through asteroid fields. When other players' units use SPACE CANNON against your units, apply -1 to the result of each die roll.
- **Plasma Scoring (Red)** - When 1 or more of your units use BOMBARDMENT or SPACE CANNON, 1 of those units may roll 1 additional die.

**Notes:** Blue and red starting techs open multiple tech paths. Antimass helps with mobility through asteroids, Plasma Scoring boosts your BOMBARDMENT (important for dreadnought-heavy builds).

### D. Faction Abilities

**Munitions Reserves:** At the start of each round of space combat, you may spend 2 trade goods; you may reroll any number of your dice during that combat round.

Incredible combat ability. Spending 2 TG to reroll ALL your dice in a combat round dramatically increases hit consistency. With large fleets, this is devastating—imagine rerolling 5 dreadnought shots. You need trade good income to fuel this.

**Armada:** The maximum number of non-fighter ships you can have in each system is equal to 2 more than the number of tokens in your fleet pool.

Your signature ability. If you have 3 fleet pool tokens, you can have 5 non-fighter ships per system instead of 3. This lets you build absolutely massive capital ship fleets that no one else can match—dreadnought armadas that dominate every system. Fighters still count against capacity, but capital ships get +2 headroom.

### E. Leaders

**Agent - Viscount Unlenn:** At the start of a space combat round: You may exhaust this card to choose 1 ship in the active system; that ship rolls 1 additional die during this combat round.

Useful for boosting a flagship or war sun's combat rolls. Solid combat support agent.

**Commander - Rear Admiral Farran:** *Unlock: Have 5 non-fighter ships in 1 system.*

After 1 of your units uses Sustain Damage: You may gain 1 trade good.

Easy unlock for Letnev (5 non-fighter ships). Generates trade goods when you use Sustain Damage, which fuels Munitions Reserves. Excellent synergy—your capital ships take hits, you get TG, you spend TG on rerolls. You literally make money from fighting. Economic engine that rewards combat aggression.

**Hero - Darktalon Treilla:** *Unlock: Have 3 scored objectives.*

**Dark Matter Affinity** - ACTION: Place this card near the game board; the number of non-fighter ships you can have in systems is not limited by laws or by the number of command tokens in your fleet pool during this game round. At the end of that game round, purge this card.

Massive repositioning tool. For one round, you ignore fleet limits entirely—build the biggest fleet imaginable and move it wherever you want. Use for critical MR push or final assault. Save for Round 4-5 (R4-R5) when it wins the game.

### F. Promissory Note - **War Funding**

After you and your opponent roll dice during space combat: You may reroll all of your opponent's dice. You may reroll any number of your dice. Then, return this card to the Letnev player.

Strong combat PN. Reroll your own dice AND your opponent's dice in combat. Trade value: 2-3 TG. Like Argent's PN, try to sell to active player so it gets used and returned quickly.

### G. Alliance

**Alliance Ability:**
*While the Letnev player's commander is unlocked:*
*After 1 of your units uses Sustain Damage, you may gain 1 trade good.*

Excellent economic alliance for factions with capital ships. Generates trade goods from combat, which can fuel various abilities. Very strong for sustained combat factions. Trade value: 3-4 TG.

### H. Mech - **Dunlain Reaper**

Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | **Sustain Damage**

**DEPLOY:** At the start of a round of ground combat, you may spend 2 resources to replace 1 of your infantry in that combat with 1 mech.

Expensive but can be deployed pre-combat by spending 2 resources. Good for surprise ground combat swings. Sustain Damage makes it durable.

**With Duranium Armor + Non-Euclidean Shielding:** Your mechs become monsters. Non-Euclidean Shielding makes them cancel 2 hits instead of 1 when using Sustain Damage, and Duranium Armor repairs 1 damaged unit each combat round. Your mechs are only rivaled by Naaz-Rokha Alliance mechs—effectively unkillable in ground combat.

### I. Flagship - **Arc Secundus**

Cost: 8 | Combat: 5 (x2) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 3 | **Sustain Damage** | **BOMBARDMENT 5 (x3)**

Other players' units in this system lose Planetary Shield. At the start of each space combat round, repair this ship.

Incredible flagship. Removes Planetary Shield from enemies (lets your BOMBARDMENT through), and repairs itself every combat round. Effectively has infinite Sustain Damage in prolonged fights. With BOMBARDMENT 5 (x3), it shreds ground forces. Essential for late game dominance.

### J. Breakthrough - **Gravleash Maneuvers (B<>R)**

Before you roll dice during space combat, apply +X to the results of 1 of your ship's rolls, where X is the number of ship types you have in the combat. During movement, your non-fighter ships' move values are equal to the highest move value amongst moving ships in the system they started in.

**B<>R Synergy:** Blue and red technologies count as each other for prerequisites.

**Movement ability - Great substitute for early Gravity Drive:** Your slow dreadnoughts and carriers can move with your faster destroyer. If you send your destroyer (move 2) with your carrier (move 1) and dreadnought (move 1), all ships move 2 because the destroyer has the highest move value. This solves a lot of slice mobility issues early game—you don't need Gravity Drive when you have this breakthrough. Excellent for fleet mobility and reaching distant planets R1.

**Breakthrough + Gravity Drive = ZOOMING:** When you eventually get Gravity Drive, your breakthrough becomes even more powerful. Gravity Drive gives +1 move to one ship (making your destroyer move 3), and Gravleash Maneuvers makes ALL your non-fighter ships move 3. Your entire fleet—dreadnoughts, carriers, flagship—can move 3 steps together. Incredible late-game mobility.

**Combat bonus:** Each ship type gives +1 to one roll. With 5 ship types (carrier, dread, cruiser, destroyer, flagship), you get +5 to one combat roll—almost guaranteed hit.

**B<>R synergy:** Opens blue and red tech paths flexibly.

### K. Slice and Draft Considerations

Letnev wants resources and access to objectives. Your priorities:

**Speaker Order:**
- **Prefer early positions (1-3)** - Lets you grab Trade and Leadership early to fuel your expensive fleet buildup.
- **Target weak neighbors** - Position yourself next to factions you can pressure with superior fleets.

**Slice Priorities:**
- **Access to Fracture or Mecatol Rex** - CRITICAL. You need a path to score points through controlling key objectives or legendary planets.
- **Prefer influence over resources** - Your home system has 6 resources already, so you prefer more influence in your slice for more balance and flexibility. Even though you have an expensive fleet, you're already set on resources.
- **Favor having 1-2 tech skips** - Tech skips help with Fracture plays. Your tech path works with B<>R synergy from Gravleash Maneuvers, so you're flexible.

**Slice Features to Avoid:**
- **No access to Fracture or Mecatol Rex** - Makes scoring difficult. Avoid if possible.
- **Low planet count with scattered systems** - Makes it hard to generate enough resources for constant production.

**Summary:**
Letnev needs access to Fracture or Mecatol Rex for scoring, high resources for fleet production, and influence planets for economy. Your tech path is perfect without skips thanks to B<>R synergy.

**Strategic Note:** Better to go for neutral objectives (Fracture, Mecatol Rex) than fighting enemies. Although you're the strongest fighting faction, it's hard to fight multiple opponents—focus on objectives rather than meaningless aggression.

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

### A. First Turn Priorities

Your Round 1 (R1) priority order: **Breakthrough > Scoring > Production > Tech**

Focus on:
1. **Breakthrough (Gravleash Maneuvers)** - MUST GET. This is essential for your fleet mobility and combat power. Top priority.
2. **Scoring** - Expand to score your R1 Stage I objective early.
3. **Production** - Build ships to allow for more expansion.
4. **Technology** - Fourth priority. Your tech path is slimmed so not a disaster to skip tech round 1.

With your strong home system (6 resources), you can try to go for all of these R1 if possible. But if you have to choose, prioritize Breakthrough first, then Scoring, then Production, then Tech.

**Expansion Notes:** You have 1 dreadnought, 1 carrier, 1 destroyer, and only 3 infantry. Your dreadnought is slow (move 1), and limited infantry means some slices can be problematic for expansion—you may struggle to hold multiple planets without sufficient ground forces. Focus on taking 2-3 nearby systems R1. Your strong combat power deters early aggression, but plan your expansion carefully around your infantry limitations.

**Strategy Token Priority:** If you have extra strategy tokens, prioritize: Diplomacy, Warfare (if no Warfare in play, then Tech)

### B. Economy Dependence

Letnev has expensive abilities and low commodity value. Your Munitions Reserves costs 2 trade goods per combat round, but you only have 2 commodities—making trade good economy critical. Your scary board presence might make diplomacy hard, as other factions may be reluctant to trade with the strongest fighting faction—or easy (extortion). You need:
- Trade agreements to generate trade goods (you only have 2 commodities, need more income)
- Commander unlock ASAP for Sustain Damage → TG economy to fuel Munitions Reserves

### C. Political Weakness

1 influence at home. You have almost no voting power. Accept that you won't win political agendas—focus on military dominance instead.

However, being the strongest fighting faction makes you a threat to everyone. This can make it hard to make good deals—players are less willing to trade with or help the faction that could crush them militarily. Your intimidating presence cuts both ways: feared in combat, but isolated diplomatically.

## V. Technology

### A. Overview

You start with **Antimass Deflectors (B)** and **Plasma Scoring (R)**.

Your main tech path focuses on:
1. **Gravity Drive (B)** - Essential for mobility
2. **Destroyer II (RR) and Non-Euclidean Shielding (RR)** - Upgraded destroyers and double Sustain Damage on all units
3. **Fleet Logistics and Lightwave Deflector** - Late game mobility and defense

### B. Tech Path

**Starting Tech:** Antimass Deflectors (B) + Plasma Scoring (R)

**Round 1: Gravity Drive (B)**
- After you activate a system, apply +1 to the move value of 1 of your ships during this tactical action.
- **Why:** ESSENTIAL. Combos with your Gravleash Maneuvers breakthrough to give your entire fleet move 3. Your destroyer becomes move 3 (2+1), and all your non-fighter ships move 3 with it. Must-have tech.
- **Prerequisites:** 1 blue (Antimass Deflectors)

**Round 2: Destroyer II (RR)**
- Cost: 1 | Combat: 8 | Move: 2 | ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE 6 (x3)
- **Why:** Better destroyers with improved combat (8 instead of 9) and devastating ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE. Critical for your fleet composition.
- **Prerequisites:** 2 red (Plasma Scoring + Gravity Drive counts as red with B<>R synergy)

**Round 3: Non-Euclidean Shielding (RR)**
- When one of your units uses Sustain Damage, cancel 2 hits instead of 1.
- **Why:** Your signature faction tech. Dreadnoughts, carriers, flagship—all take 2 hits to damage instead of 1. Makes your fleets incredibly durable.
- **Prerequisites:** 2 red (Plasma Scoring + Destroyer II or Gravity Drive)

**Round 4: Duranium Armor (RR)**
- During each combat round, after you assign hits to your units, repair 1 of your damaged units that did not use Sustain Damage during this combat round.
- **Why:** Repairs a ship each combat round. Stacks with Non-Euclidean Shielding for nearly unkillable fleets.
- **Prerequisites:** 2 red (any two red techs you already have)

**Round 5+:** Flex techs based on objectives and game state

### C. Flex Techs

**Carrier II (BB) - For Unit Upgrade Objectives:**
- Cost: 3 | Combat: 9 | Move: 2 | Capacity: 6
- **Why:** If you need a 2nd unit upgrade for "Develop Weaponry" objective (2 unit upgrade technologies), Carrier II works fine. The extra capacity is useful.
- **Prerequisites:** 2 blue (Antimass + Gravity Drive)

**Note on Dreadnought II:** Not recommended. The extra movement on dreadnoughts (move 2 instead of move 1) is not helpful with Gravleash Maneuvers breakthrough—your breakthrough already makes dreadnoughts move at the same speed as your destroyer (move 2, or move 3 with Gravity Drive). Skip Dreadnought II.

---

## VI. Strategy Cards

### A. Round 1 Priority

1. **Trade** - You have 2 commodities and need economy for your expensive abilities
2. **Leadership** - Command tokens for production and expansion
3. **Politics** - For breakthrough exploration. Breakthrough is key.
4. **Technology** - Pay 5 resources for expedition, save 4 resources from skipping secondary. Get started on tech path.
5. **Diplomacy** - For breakthrough exploration if Politics doesn't get it. Breakthrough is key.
6. **Construction** - Double dock at home (build 2nd space dock in home system)
7. **Warfare** - Redeploy + free activation
8. **Imperial** - Never R1

### B. Round 2+ Priority

**Love:**
- **Leadership** - Command tokens for fleet spam and production
- **Trade** - Need trade good income for Munitions Reserves. Economy balance.

**Like:**
- **Technology** - Staying on tech path. Allows for easy double tech to make scary techs come earlier.
- **Imperial** - Needed once when on Mecatol Rex
- **Politics** - Agenda control
- **Construction** - Good until you have no space docks left to build

**Situational:**
- **Warfare** - Only if playing very aggressively. Anti-synergy: moving tokens from fleet pool reduces Armada capacity (you get +2 ships per fleet token). Also conflicts with Hero ability that ignores fleet limits.
- **Diplomacy** - Rarely useful

---

## VII. Intermediate

### A. Unit Composition

Your ideal fleet composition in each system:

**Minimum core:**
- **1 Destroyer** - For Gravleash movement bonus and screening
- **1 Carrier** - For capacity
- **1 Dreadnought** - For combat power and Sustain Damage

**Then add as needed:**
- **Flagship** - Strong flagship for critical systems
- **Fighters** - Absorb hits
- **Infantry** - Ground forces
- **Mechs** - Deploy when needed using DEPLOY ability (spend 2 resources to replace infantry mid-combat)

Build up your capital ship count with Armada. With 3 fleet pool tokens, you can have 5 non-fighter ships per system instead of 3. Fill those extra slots with more dreadnoughts as your economy allows.

### B. Game Plan

**Focus on Neutral Objectives, Not Aggression:**

Although you're the strongest fighting faction in TI4, it's better to go for neutral objectives (Fracture, Mecatol Rex) than fighting enemies. You're strong in 1v1 combat, but it's hard to fight multiple opponents—players will gang up on you if you're too aggressive. Focus on objectives rather than conquest.

**Fracture Strategy:**

Getting relics in Fracture should be free for Letnev. Your superior fleet can easily take and hold Fracture without much resistance. With Gravleash Maneuvers breakthrough + Gravity Drive, your entire fleet can move 3 steps, giving you incredible reach to Fracture. Use this mobility to claim relics and legendary planets for easy points.

**Mecatol Rex Control:**

Your massive fleets (thanks to Armada) and combat superiority make you the best faction for holding Mecatol Rex. Park a 5-dreadnought fleet on MR, take Imperial when you control it, and score those MR points. Your Non-Euclidean Shielding and Duranium Armor make it nearly impossible to dislodge you once established.

**Styx Easy Access:**

With your move 3 fleet (Gravleash + Gravity Drive), Styx is an easy point to access. Your mobility lets you reach distant legendary planets that other factions struggle to get to. Free points from hard-to-reach objectives.

**Legend:** 🟢 Likely | 🟡 Possible | 🔴 Difficult

**Notes:**
- Influence and trade goods spending objectives are hard
- Control objectives and movement objectives are easy

## IX. Alliance Priority

Trading for other factions' Alliance promissory notes (which give you access to their Commanders) can significantly boost your strategy. Here are the top alliances to prioritize:

**Super Top Tier:**
1. **Jol-Nar (Ta Zern)** - Reroll dice for unit abilities. Reroll BOMBARDMENT, SPACE CANNON. Excellent for your flagship and dreadnoughts.
2. **Ghosts of Creuss (2RAM)** - Units that have Planetary Shield do not prevent you from using BOMBARDMENT. Top tier for invasion-focused Letnev. Your dreadnoughts have BOMBARDMENT 5—bypass Planetary Shield entirely.
3. **Winnu (Rickar Rickani)** - +2 combat in MR, your home system, and legendary systems. Makes you unstoppable on Mecatol Rex. You probably won't get this alliance without a ceasefire—Winnu knows how powerful this is for you.
4. **Nomad (Navarch Feng)** - Produce flagship without spending resources. Always good value. Saves 8 resources for dreadnought production.
5. **Muaat (Magmus)** - After you spend strategy token, gain 1 trade good. Very good for generating TG income to fuel Munitions Reserves.

**Really Useful:**
6. **Titans of Ul (Tungstantus)** - When you use PRODUCTION, gain 1 trade good. Useful for constant TG income, but not critical.

## X. End Notes

Barony of Letnev is the strongest fighting faction in TI4 with unmatched fleet dominance. Your job is to:

1. **Get Gravleash Maneuvers breakthrough R1** - MUST GET. Enables fleet mobility and B<>R tech synergy
2. **Build effective fleets** - Different ship types, high movement, and strong power. Leverage Armada for 2 extra non-fighter ships per system
3. **Leverage strong techs in ground and space combat** - Your tech path gives you powerful advantages
4. **Unlock Commander ASAP** - Sustain Damage → TG economy (make money from fighting)
5. **Make a few daring plays early** - You need it to keep up in economy
6. **Focus on neutral objectives** - Go for Fracture and Mecatol Rex rather than fighting enemies

Don't let anyone contest your naval superiority. You're the strongest fighting faction in TI4. Build dreadnoughts, reroll combat dice, and dominate through overwhelming firepower—**laughing maniacally**.
