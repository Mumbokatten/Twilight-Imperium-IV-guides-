# Arborec Guide

![Arborec Letani Warrior](ARBOREC.webp)

---

## I. Introduction

Arborec is one of the most satisfying factions to master in TI4. This faction rewards patience and strategic thinking with an unstoppable late-game presence that can overwhelm the entire board. Arborec isn't about explosive early plays—it's about methodical expansion and leveraging a unique production economy to dominate by mid-to-late game.

The payoff? Watching your opponents realize too late that you've quietly grown an empire of 30+ infantry across 10+ planets, each capable of producing units. The slow burn becomes an unstoppable wildfire.

## II. Playstyle

Playing Arborec is like tending a garden. Plant seeds (infantry) everywhere, water them (produce with Letani Warrior PRODUCTION), and harvest a board state where you control more planets than anyone thought possible.

The key misconception about Arborec is that they're weak early game. Wrong—they're *investing*. Every infantry placed is a future production facility. Every planet taken is another node in an ever-expanding production network.

Opponents will underestimate you until suddenly they realize you have 30+ infantry spread across 8 systems, each one capable of producing units. By then, you've already achieved board dominance. That moment of realization? Pure fun.

## III. The Basics

### A. Home System & Commodities

**Home System:**
- **Nestphar:** 3 resources / 2 influence
- **Total: 3 resources / 2 influence (3 optimal resources / 0 optimal influence)**

**Commodities:** 3

**Notes:** Single-planet home system with decent resources (3) but low influence (2). The 3 resources are solid for early production, but you'll need to expand quickly to gain more economic power.

### B. Starting Fleet
- 1 Carrier
- 1 Cruiser
- 2 Fighters
- 4 Infantry
- 1 Space Dock
- 1 PDS

**Notes:** You can use your Agent (Letani Ospha) to upgrade your cruiser into either a 2nd carrier (for more capacity) or a dreadnought (for combat power), depending on your needs. Combined with your breakthrough (Psychospore) for an additional movement, this lets you easily reach and capture 3 systems on your first round with proper ship distribution.

### C. Faction Abilities

**Mitosis (Faction Ability):** Your space docks cannot produce infantry. At the start of the status phase, place 1 infantry from your reinforcements on any planet you control.

**Strategic Note:** Use Mitosis almost exclusively for converting to mechs via your mech's DEPLOY ability (see H. Mech section). Instead of placing a free infantry, replace it with a mech from reinforcements. This gives you free mechs (worth 2 resources each) every status phase without spending resources. Only place regular infantry when you don't have mechs available in reinforcements or need emergency PRODUCTION coverage.

**Letani Warrior I (Infantry):** Cost: 1 (x2) | Combat: 8 | PRODUCTION 1

This is your secret weapon. Every infantry has PRODUCTION 1, making them mobile production facilities. Let that sink in.

### D. Starting and Faction Technologies

**Starting Technology:**

**Magen Defense Grid Ω (RR):**
*When any player activates a system that contains 1 or more of your structures, place 1 infantry from your reinforcements with each of those structures. At the start of ground combat on a planet that contains 1 or more of your structures, produce 1 hit and assign it to 1 of your opponent's ground forces.*

- Allows for 2 bonus infantry with your 2 starting structures (space dock and PDS) which is superb
- Free infantry placement when systems with your structures are activated
- Defensive hit in ground combat on planets with structures
- Synergizes with Psychospore breakthrough (R<>G) to count as green prerequisite

**Faction Technologies:**

**Letani Warrior II (GG):**
*Cost: 1 (x2) | Combat: 7 | PRODUCTION 2*

After this unit is destroyed, roll 1 die. If the result is 6 or greater, place the unit on this card. At the start of your next turn, place each unit that is on this card on a planet you control in your home system.

- Upgraded infantry with better combat (7 instead of 8) and PRODUCTION 2 (double the base)
- PRODUCTION 2 can feel like too much (is there such a thing?), but gives flexibility to produce where your main armies aren't
- Resurrection ability: 50% chance to return destroyed infantry next turn
- Requires 2 green prerequisites (green skip or Bio-Stims (G) with Psychospore R<>G synergy)
- Non-blue tech path prioritizes this upgrade

**Bioplasmosis (GG):**
*At the end of the status phase, you may remove any number of infantry from planets you control and place them on 1 or more planets you control in the same or adjacent systems.*

- Skip this tech - you're already spread out with your mobile production
- Your infantry have PRODUCTION 1, making them natural production facilities wherever they are
- Rarely need to reposition armies since you produce everywhere

### E. Leaders

**Agent - Letani Ospha:** ACTION: Exhaust this card and choose a player's non-fighter ship; that player may replace that ship with one from their reinforcements that costs up to 2 more than the replaced ship.

Useful for helping players upgrade their ships or as a trade incentive. Can be used to help someone get a critical unit upgrade mid-game.

**Commander - Dirzuga Rophal:** *Unlock: Have 12 ground forces on planets you control.*
After another player activates a system that contains 1 or more of your units that have PRODUCTION, you may produce 1 unit in that system.

This commander functions primarily as a deterrent. Once unlocked, opponents become hesitant to activate systems containing your infantry (which have PRODUCTION), as you can immediately produce a unit there. This discourages aggression and helps protect your spread-out forces. You should be aiming to unlock this R2-R3.

**Hero - Letani Miasmiala:** *Unlock: Have 3 scored objectives.* **Ultrasonic Emitter: Overgrowth** - ACTION: Produce any number of units in any number of systems that contain 1 or more of your ground forces. Then, purge this card.

Massive swing turn potential. Save this for a crucial moment—usually right before scoring a Stage II or making a final push for victory. Don't waste it early.

### F. Promissory Note - **Stymie**

After another player moves ships into a system that contains 1 or more of your units: You may place 1 command token from that player's reinforcements in any non-home system. Then, return this card to the Arborec player.

Situational defensive card that can delay an opponent's moves or lock down key systems. Trade value: 2-4 TG depending on context.

### G. Alliance

When you produce ships, you may produce 1 additional fighter or infantry for its cost.

Solid production bonus for economic factions. Trade value: 3-4 TG or equivalent.

### H. Mech - **Letani Behemoth**

Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | **Sustain Damage** | **PRODUCTION 2** | **Planetary Shield**

**DEPLOY:** When you would use your Mitosis faction ability, you may replace 1 of your infantry with 1 mech from your reinforcements instead.

Mechs are very strong for Arborec. They give you staying power in combat, have PRODUCTION 2 (double that of infantry), and provide Planetary Shield. **Crucially, you should primarily get mechs through the DEPLOY ability using Mitosis** - converting your free infantry into mechs each status phase is far more efficient than spending 2 resources to produce them. This lets you build up 2-3 mechs by R3-R4 without spending resources on them.

### I. Flagship - **Duha Menaimon**

Cost: 8 | Combat: 7 (x2) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 5 | **Sustain Damage**

After you activate this system, you may produce up to 5 units in this system.

Historically a weak flagship, but receives a significant buff with your Psychospore breakthrough expedition. The flagship's ability to produce 5 units on activation synergizes well with Psychospore's ability to reclaim the command token afterward, letting you produce without permanently committing the token. This makes the flagship viable for holding key systems like Mecatol Rex.

### J. Breakthrough - **Psychospore (R<>G)**

**R<>G Synergy:** Red and green technologies count as each other for prerequisites.

**ACTION:** Exhaust this card to remove a command token from a system that contains 1 or more of your infantry and return it to your reinforcements. Then, place 1 infantry in that system.

**Analysis:** This breakthrough is absolutely critical for Arborec. The primary benefits are:

1. **Mobility** - Reclaim command tokens from systems to reactivate them elsewhere, giving you flexible activation economy
2. **Production** - Place an additional infantry (with PRODUCTION 1) each time you use this ability, expanding your production network

The **R<>G synergy** is crucial for non-blue tech paths—it allows your Magen Defense Grid (red) to count as green for prerequisites, enabling you to research Letani Warrior II (GG) with just one green skip on R2. This makes the non-blue tech path viable by opening green technologies without needing actual green prerequisites.

Securing Psychospore R1 is your top priority.

### K. Slice and Draft Considerations

When drafting your slice and choosing speaker order as Arborec:

**Speaker Order:**
- **Try to be among the first 3 in speaker order** - Lets you secure key strategy cards (Technology, Production, Leadership) early.
- **If possible, sit next to a target neighbor** - Position yourself next to a faction you can pressure or extract value from.

**Slice Priorities:**
1. **Fracture access** - Positioning that lets you reach The Fracture easily. Fracture provides valuable planets and relics for expansion and objectives.
2. **Scoring opportunities** - Access to Mecatol Rex, legendary planets, or objective-friendly systems. You need points to win.
3. **Tech skip (blue preferred)** - Blue skip enables the blue tech path (Gravity Drive (B), Carrier II (BB), Fleet Logistics (BB)), which is your strongest option. Green/red skips can work for non-blue paths but are less impactful.

**Slice Features to Avoid:**
- **Asteroid fields on the way to Mecatol Rex** - Slows movement and disrupts expansion paths. Very annoying.
- **Gravity rifts on the way to Mecatol Rex** - Complicates your path to MR. Avoid if possible.
- **Empty system tiles near your home** - While infantry in space can still produce, you'd rather have planets to land on and control for resources. Empty systems limit your production capacity and waste slice value.

**Neutral/Fine:**
- **Entropic Scar** - Fine but nothing special. Not a priority to seek out.
- **Planet count (4-6 planets)** - Everyone wants high planet counts. Don't overprioritize this—focus on skips and resources instead.

---

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

### A. First Turn Problems

Your Round 1 (R1) is all about setting up your engine. The priority order is:

1. **Breakthrough Expedition** - Secure Psychospore (R<>G) for mobility and production benefits. This is mandatory.
2. **Scoring** - Expand to capture 1-3 systems to score your R1 Stage I objective. Don't sacrifice your economy for hard objectives.
3. **Technology** - Begin your tech path if you have resources available after breakthrough and expansion
4. **Production** - Happens naturally through expansion and using your space dock. You can produce plenty R2, so don't stress this R1.

Your ideal R1 involves taking Trade or Leadership, producing from your home system, securing Psychospore breakthrough, and expanding to 1-3 systems to score objectives.

**Strategy Token Usage R1:** You have 2 strategy tokens R1. Spend them on **Diplomacy** and **Technology** secondaries if possible. Otherwise, save them—you don't need other secondaries R1.

### B. Command Counter Scarcity

You will burn through command counters producing everywhere. Leadership becomes one of your best cards. You need 4-5 strategy pool tokens by R3-4 to really pop off.

### C. Slow Start

You don't score easy Round 1-2 (R1-R2) points like other factions. Accept this. Your scoring curve is R3-R5, where you suddenly have the board state to score 2-3 points per round.

---

## V. Technology

### A. Overview

**Starting Technology:** Magen Defense Grid - At the start of ground combat on a planet that contains 1 or more of your structures, you may produce 1 hit and assign it to 1 of your opponent's ground forces.

You start with **Magen Defense Grid**. Your R1 priority is securing **Psychospore breakthrough expedition (R<>G)**.

**Critical Synergy:** Psychospore's R<>G synergy allows your red and green techs to count as each other for prerequisites. The breakthrough itself is NOT a tech and does NOT count as a prerequisite. It simply enables your **Magen Defense Grid** to count as **green** when researching green techs, allowing you to get **Letani Warrior II (GG) on R2** with just 1 green skip!

After securing Psychospore breakthrough R1, your tech path splits based on objectives and slice.

### B. Tech Path 1: Blue Path (Standard)

This is your default path. More solid and consistent, prioritizes mobility and fleet composition.

**Round 1:** Sarween Tools (Y) if you teched R1 and have influence slice (value pick), otherwise skip tech R1 and secure Psychospore breakthrough only
- **Sarween Tools:** When you use PRODUCTION, reduce the combined cost of produced units by 1

**Round 2:** Dark Energy Tap or Antimass Deflectors - Prefer Dark Energy Tap for resources. **With blue skip:** Can skip this and go Sarween Tools if greedy, or straight to Gravity Drive (B)
- **Dark Energy Tap:** After you perform a tactical action in a system with a frontier token, if you have ships there, explore that token. Your ships can retreat into adjacent systems that don't contain other players' units
- **Antimass Deflectors:** Your ships can move through asteroid fields. Apply -1 to SPACE CANNON rolls against your units

**Round 3:** Gravity Drive (B) if you skipped DET/Antimass, otherwise Carrier II (BB) - Magen (counts as blue) + Gravity Drive (B) + blue skip
- **Gravity Drive (B):** After you activate a system, apply +1 to the move value of 1 of your ships during this tactical action
- **Carrier II (BB):** Move 2, Capacity 6 (upgrade from Move 1, Capacity 4)

**Round 4:** Carrier II (BB) if skipped R3, otherwise Fleet Logistics (BB)
- **Fleet Logistics (BB):** During each of your turns in the action phase, you may perform 2 actions instead of 1

**Round 5:** Fleet Logistics (BB) if skipped R4, otherwise flex for objectives

**Tech Requirements:**
- Yellow skip (for Sarween R1 if you tech early)
- Red skip (helpful but not required)
- Green skip (bonus)
- Blue skip (nice): Allows you to skip Dark Energy Tap/Antimass Deflectors and go straight to Gravity Drive (B) or take greedy Sarween Tools path

**Pros:**
- Dark Energy Tap synergizes with spreading out across the map
- Carrier II (BB) + Gravity Drive (B) = best mobility in game
- Fleet Logistics (BB) enables winning maneuvers late game
- Better map control and expansion
- More solid and reliable overall

**Cons:**
- No Letani Warrior II (skips faction tech entirely)
- Takes until R4 for full power

**Best For:** Most situations. Recommended default path.

---

### C. Tech Path 2: Non-Blue (Alternative)

Alternative path focused on economy and ground force power. No blue techs required.

**Round 1:** (Secure Psychospore breakthrough - not a tech!)

**Round 2:** Sarween Tools (Y) - Economy boost, stacks with production spam
- **Sarween Tools:** When you use PRODUCTION, reduce the combined cost of produced units by 1

**Round 3:** Bio-Stims (G) - Economy tool that refreshes planets, doubles your resource/influence output and production capability
- **Bio-Stims (G):** Exhaust this card at the end of your turn to ready 1 planet with a technology specialty or 1 of your other technologies

**Round 4:** Destroyer II (RR) - Fleet power
- **Destroyer II (RR):** Cost 1, Combat 8, Move 2, ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE 6 (x3)

**Round 5:** Letani Warrior II (GG) if no green skip, OR X-89 Bacterial Weapon (GGG) with green skip only, otherwise flex for objectives
- **Letani Warrior II (GG):** Cost 1 (x2), Combat 7, PRODUCTION 2. After destroyed, roll 1 die. If 6+, place on this card. At start of your next turn, place each unit on this card on a planet you control in your home system
- **X-89 Bacterial Weapon (GGG):** After you use BOMBARDMENT against a planet and destroy at least 1 infantry, destroy ALL opponent infantry on that planet

**Note:** You may swap Letani Warrior II for a colored tech if objectives require specific tech colors.

**Pros:**
- Sarween and Biostims provide strong economy/resource generation
- Destroyer II (RR) gives fleet combat power
- Can get X-89 R5 with green skip for lethal ground combat
- Can get Letani Warrior II R5 as fallback

**Cons:**
- Move 1 carriers remain a bottleneck all game
- Less reliable than blue path
- Slower than blue path to get mobility
- Delays or skips Letani Warrior II if going X-89 route

**Best For:** Unit upgrade strength and massive production capabilities. Has movement bottleneck but compensates with stronger ground and fleet combat.

---

### D. Tech Priorities by Slice & Neighbors

**Resource-Heavy Slice:** Blue path (standard). Dark Energy Tap requires a few empty systems to be valuable. Slight favor toward Dreadnought II (BBY) later since you can afford cost 4 units.

**Influence-Heavy Slice + Weak Neighbor:** Non-Blue path (invasion). Sarween Tools + Bio-Stims (G) economy, Destroyer II (RR) affordable with fleet pool, X-89 Bacterial Weapon (GGG) for conquering neighbor's planets.

---

## VI. Strategy Cards

### A. Round 1

Your Round 1 (R1) priority is securing **Psychospore breakthrough expedition** (R<>G) for command token economy and enabling your engine. This drives your strategy card choices.

**Round 1 Priority Ranking:**

1. **Trade** - You have 3 commodities and desperately need the economy to fund expansion and securing breakthrough expedition. Best pick.

2. **Leadership** - Command counters enable more activations and you need the value. Strong second choice.

3. **Politics** - Agenda control and speaker trading provide solid value. Can work well if Trade/Leadership are taken.

4. **Diplomacy** - Situational but can be useful for protecting key systems or locking down important tiles.

5. **Technology** - Gets you breakthrough expedition directly, but risky if you can't secure Psychospore or if someone takes Tech first.

6. **Construction** - Problematic because you can only produce from 1 space dock, limiting your expansion.

7. **Warfare** - No longer useful for your R1 game plan.

8. **Imperial** - Never pick this R1. You're not scoring and you don't want first pick R2.

### B. Round 2+

**Love:**
- **Leadership** - Spam production all turn. This is your best friend R3-R5.
- **Trade** - 3 commodities means 3 TG per refresh. Always good to have flexible economy.
- **Imperial** - You need MR points. Take this R3-R4 when you can hold MR.

**Like:**
- **Politics** - Agenda control is always good.
- **Technology** - Staying on your tech path is valuable and saves you from spending 6 resources to double tech. Really consider the value of the tech before taking Technology primary - resources saved aren't always worth the strategy card slot.

**Situational:**
- **Diplomacy** - Only useful R1 or late game for key system lockdowns (note: Mecatol Rex cannot be locked). Otherwise skip.
- **Warfare** - Only take if you have a specific aggressive play in mind. Otherwise not worth it.

**Hate:**
- **Construction** - New construction primary trolls you (opponents get free structures while you don't need them). No need for PDS/production facilities. Only take if structure objectives force you to.

---

## VII. Intermediate

### A. Unit Composition

Your ideal fleet composition in each system:

- **Carrier + Fighter screen** - Core of your fleet for capacity and defense
- **1 Dreadnought or Flagship** - Critical for getting hits and adding HP pool to sustain damage
- **1 Mech** - Protection against bombardment (Planetary Shield)
- **Infantry** - Your primary ground force and production units

This composition gives you staying power in space combat (dread/flagship for hits, fighters for screening), protection against bombardment (mech), and your signature infantry swarm. Without the dreadnought/flagship, your fleets lack the punch to get hits in combat and the HP to survive enemy fire.

**Note:** If you have a heavy influence slice, Destroyer II (RR) can replace dreadnoughts in your fleet composition. Heavy influence gives you more fleet pool to support destroyers, while having less resources makes dreads (cost 4) harder to afford. Destroyer II (RR) becomes the better choice in this economic profile.

### B. Game Plan

**Strategic Paths - Mecatol Rex vs Neighbor vs Fracture:**

You have three main strategic paths to choose from Round 2-3 (R2-R3):

1. **Go for Mecatol Rex** - Your default path. Your massive infantry production and board presence make you excellent at holding MR. If you can secure a planet next to Mecatol Rex, build PDS and infantry to defend approaches.

2. **Attack a Neighbor** - If you have a weak neighbor or can extract value from pressuring them, use your infantry swarm to take their planets. Your Letani Warriors have PRODUCTION, so every planet you take becomes a production facility.

3. **Fracture Strategy (3rd Option)** - If The Fracture is in the map and you have an **ingress portal (wormhole) in your slice**, this can be a bonus opportunity.

**When to Choose Fracture:**
- **No one is grabbing Fracture** (bonus opportunity)
- **Mecatol Rex looks scary** (heavily contested or dangerous)
- **No vulnerable neighbor factions** (everyone around you is strong)

**Fracture Execution:**
1. **Move to Fracture** (first movement)
2. **Use breakthrough to move again** (second movement - exploring happens at the end of this movement to grab the relic)

**Prefer the 2-planet/relic side** over the 1-planet side, but both work depending on board state.

**WARNING:** This strategy is risky. You become a target while "in the air" and you'll have many ships stuck in The Fracture system. Only execute this if you can defend your position or if the relic/planets are worth the exposure.

**Custodians Token / Mecatol Rex:**

**Strongly advised against grabbing the Custodians token R2.** This is very risky for Arborec because it impacts your economy (you need resources R2-R3 to build your engine), hurts scoring (can't score Stage I objectives while holding Custodians), and makes you a target when you're still weak.

**Recommended approach:** Let someone else take Custodians R2. Build up your infantry swarm R2-R3, then take Mecatol Rex from them R3-R4. When you take it from another player using Imperial, you score 1 point for controlling MR plus 1 bonus point for taking it from another player = 2 points total.

**Key principle:** When you enter Mecatol Rex, you don't want to lose it. Only take MR when you can hold it with overwhelming infantry and mechs (8-12+ ground forces). Your defensive strength comes from massing units, not early aggression.

**Styx Consideration:**

**Styx is out of range for non-blue tech path** but becomes **viable with blue tech path** (Gravity Drive (B) + Fleet Logistics (BB)). It can serve as a late-game guaranteed point for objectives like "Become a Legend" or other anomaly/legendary planet objectives.

---

## VIII. Objectives

### A. Objective Summary

**Strengths:** Arborec excels at planet control objectives due to widespread infantry production and natural expansion patterns. Your ability to produce units anywhere makes positioning objectives and control-based Stage II objectives trivial.

**Weaknesses:** Tech diversity objectives are challenging due to limited tech paths, and spending objectives can be difficult early game before your engine is fully established. Structure objectives are also problematic since you rely on infantry PRODUCTION rather than building facilities.

### B. Stage I Objectives

| Stage I Objective                                                       | Status |

Arborec is one of the best control objective factions in the game. You will naturally have 8-12 planets by R4-R5.

## IX. Alliance Priority

Trading for other factions' Alliance promissory notes (which give you access to their Commanders) can significantly boost your strategy. Here are the top alliances to prioritize:

**Super Top Tier:**
1. **Titans of Ul (Tungstantus)** - When you use PRODUCTION, gain 1 trade good. Perfect synergy with constant production.
2. **Nomad (Navarch Feng)** - Produce your flagship without spending resources. Always good value (saves 8 resources).
3. **Winnu (Rickar Rickani)** - Apply +2 to combat rolls in Mecatol Rex, your home system, and legendary planet systems. Great combat boost.
4. **Sardakk N'orr (G'hom Sek'kus)** - During Commit Ground Forces, commit 1 ground force from each planet in active/adjacent systems. Invasion flexibility with your infantry swarm.

**Really Useful:**
5. **Deepwrought (Aello)** - When you research tech, reduce cost by 1 resource. More money for production.
6. **Naaz-Rokha (Dart and Tai)** - After you gain control of a planet from another player, explore that planet. Good for conquest plays.
7. **Muaat (Magmus)** - After you spend token from strategy pool, gain 1 trade good. Good economy boost.
8. **Saar (Rowl Sarring)** - When you produce fighters/infantry, place them at ANY of your space docks. Flexibility for spreading units.
9. **Empyrean (Xuange)** - After another player moves ships into system with your token, return token to reinforcements. Late game slaying.

## XI. End Notes

Arborec is a powerhouse disguised as a slow faction. Expand aggressively Round 1-2 (preferably 6+ planets), decide on your path R2-R3 (Mecatol Rex or neighbor pressure), get Imperial R3/4 to maintain scoring tempo, use your Hero R4 to build a massive army across multiple systems, and adapt R5 to solve whatever situation comes at you with your overwhelming production.

Don't let anyone tell you Arborec is weak. You're an S-tier control faction with unmatched production potential. Play patient, play smart, and grow your forest across the galaxy.
