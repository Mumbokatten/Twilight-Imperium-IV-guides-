<h2 id="i.-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>
<p>Arborec is one of the most satisfying factions to master in TI4. This
faction rewards patience and strategic thinking with an unstoppable
late-game presence that can overwhelm the entire board. Arborec isn’t
about explosive early plays—it’s about methodical expansion and
leveraging a unique production economy to dominate by mid-to-late
game.</p>
<p>The payoff? Watching your opponents realize too late that you’ve
quietly grown an empire of 30+ infantry across 10+ planets, each capable
of producing units. The slow burn becomes an unstoppable wildfire.</p>
<h2 id="ii.-playstyle">II. Playstyle</h2>
<p>Playing Arborec is like tending a garden. Plant seeds (infantry)
everywhere, water them (produce with Letani Warrior PRODUCTION), and
harvest a board state where you control more planets than anyone thought
possible.</p>
<p>The key misconception about Arborec is that they’re weak early game.
Wrong—they’re <em>investing</em>. Every infantry placed is a future
production facility. Every planet taken is another node in an
ever-expanding production network.</p>
<p>Opponents will underestimate you until suddenly they realize you have
30+ infantry spread across 8 systems, each one capable of producing
units. By then, you’ve already achieved board dominance. That moment of
realization? Pure fun.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iii.-the-basics">III. The Basics</h2>
<h3 id="a.-home-system-commodities">A. Home System &amp;
Commodities</h3>
<p><strong>Home System:</strong> - <strong>Nestphar:</strong> 3
resources / 2 influence - <strong>Total: 3 resources / 2 influence (3
optimal resources / 0 optimal influence)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commodities:</strong> 3</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Single-planet home system with decent
resources (3) but low influence (2). The 3 resources are solid for early
production, but you’ll need to expand quickly to gain more economic
power.</p>
<h3 id="b.-starting-fleet">B. Starting Fleet</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 Carrier</li>
<li>1 Cruiser</li>
<li>2 Fighters</li>
<li>4 Infantry</li>
<li>1 Space Dock</li>
<li>1 PDS</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> You can use your Agent (Letani Ospha) to
upgrade your cruiser into either a 2nd carrier (for more capacity) or a
dreadnought (for combat power), depending on your needs. This
flexibility lets you easily capture 3 systems on your first round with
proper ship distribution.</p>
<h3 id="c.-starting-tech">C. Starting Tech</h3>
<p><strong>Magen Defense Grid (Red):</strong> <em>At the start of ground
combat on a planet that contains 1 or more of your structures, you may
produce 1 hit and assign it to 1 of your opponent’s ground
forces.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Starting red technology</li>
<li>Defensive ground combat advantage</li>
<li>Triggers when defending planets with structures (space docks,
PDS)</li>
<li>Opens red technology path</li>
<li>Synergizes with Psychospore breakthrough (R&lt;&gt;G) to count as
green prerequisite</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="d.-faction-abilities">D. Faction Abilities</h3>
<p><strong>Mitosis (Faction Ability):</strong> Your space docks cannot
produce infantry. At the start of the status phase, place 1 infantry
from your reinforcements on any planet you control.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Note:</strong> Use Mitosis almost exclusively for
converting to mechs via your mech’s DEPLOY ability (see H. Mech
section). Instead of placing a free infantry, replace it with a mech
from reinforcements. This gives you free mechs (worth 2 resources each)
every status phase without spending resources. Only place regular
infantry when you don’t have mechs available in reinforcements or need
emergency PRODUCTION coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Letani Warrior I (Infantry):</strong> Cost: 1 (x2) | Combat:
8 | PRODUCTION 1</p>
<p>This is your secret weapon. Every infantry has PRODUCTION 1, making
them mobile production facilities. Let that sink in.</p>
<h3 id="e.-leaders">E. Leaders</h3>
<p><strong>Agent - Letani Ospha:</strong> ACTION: Exhaust this card and
choose a player’s non-fighter ship; that player may replace that ship
with one from their reinforcements that costs up to 2 more than the
replaced ship.</p>
<p>Useful for helping players upgrade their ships or as a trade
incentive. Can be used to help someone get a critical unit upgrade
mid-game.</p>
<p><strong>Commander - Dirzuga Rophal:</strong> <em>Unlock: Have 12
ground forces on planets you control.</em> After another player
activates a system that contains 1 or more of your units that have
PRODUCTION, you may produce 1 unit in that system.</p>
<p>This commander functions primarily as a deterrent. Once unlocked,
opponents become hesitant to activate systems containing your infantry
(which have PRODUCTION), as you can immediately produce a unit there.
This discourages aggression and helps protect your spread-out forces.
You should be aiming to unlock this R2-R3.</p>
<p><strong>Hero - Letani Miasmiala:</strong> <em>Unlock: Have 3 scored
objectives.</em> <strong>Ultrasonic Emitter: Overgrowth</strong> -
ACTION: Produce any number of units in any number of systems that
contain 1 or more of your ground forces. Then, purge this card.</p>
<p>Massive swing turn potential. Save this for a crucial moment—usually
right before scoring a Stage II or making a final push for victory.
Don’t waste it early.</p>
<h3 id="f.-promissory-note---stymie">F. Promissory Note -
<strong>Stymie</strong></h3>
<p>After another player moves ships into a system that contains 1 or
more of your units: You may place 1 command token from that player’s
reinforcements in any non-home system. Then, return this card to the
Arborec player.</p>
<p>Situational defensive card that can delay an opponent’s moves or lock
down key systems. Trade value: 2-4 TG depending on context.</p>
<h3 id="g.-alliance">G. Alliance</h3>
<p>When you produce ships, you may produce 1 additional fighter or
infantry for its cost.</p>
<p>Solid production bonus for economic factions. Trade value: 3-4 TG or
equivalent.</p>
<h3 id="h.-mech---letani-behemoth">H. Mech - <strong>Letani
Behemoth</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | <strong>Sustain Damage</strong> |
<strong>PRODUCTION 2</strong> | <strong>Planetary Shield</strong></p>
<p><strong>DEPLOY:</strong> When you would use your Mitosis faction
ability, you may replace 1 of your infantry with 1 mech from your
reinforcements instead.</p>
<p>Mechs are very strong for Arborec. They give you staying power in
combat, have PRODUCTION 2 (double that of infantry), and provide
Planetary Shield. <strong>Crucially, you should primarily get mechs
through the DEPLOY ability using Mitosis</strong> - converting your free
infantry into mechs each status phase is far more efficient than
spending 2 resources to produce them. This lets you build up 2-3 mechs
by R3-R4 without spending resources on them.</p>
<h3 id="i.-flagship---duha-menaimon">I. Flagship - <strong>Duha
Menaimon</strong></h3>
<p>Cost: 8 | Combat: 7 (x2) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 5 | <strong>Sustain
Damage</strong></p>
<p>After you activate this system, you may produce up to 5 units in this
system.</p>
<p>Historically a weak flagship, but receives a significant buff with
your Psychospore breakthrough expedition. The flagship’s ability to
produce 5 units on activation synergizes well with Psychospore’s ability
to reclaim the command token afterward, letting you produce without
permanently committing the token. This makes the flagship viable for
holding key systems like Mecatol Rex.</p>
<h3 id="j.-breakthrough---psychospore-rg">J. Breakthrough -
<strong>Psychospore (R&lt;&gt;G)</strong></h3>
<p><strong>R&lt;&gt;G Synergy:</strong> Red and green technologies count
as each other for prerequisites.</p>
<p><strong>ACTION:</strong> Exhaust this card to remove a command token
from a system that contains 1 or more of your infantry and return it to
your reinforcements. Then, place 1 infantry in that system.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This breakthrough is absolutely critical
for Arborec. The primary benefits are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Mobility</strong> - Reclaim command tokens from systems to
reactivate them elsewhere, giving you flexible activation economy</li>
<li><strong>Production</strong> - Place an additional infantry (with
PRODUCTION 1) each time you use this ability, expanding your production
network</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>R&lt;&gt;G synergy</strong> is crucial for non-blue tech
paths—it allows your Magen Defense Grid (red) to count as green for
prerequisites, enabling you to research Letani Warrior II (GG) with just
one green skip on R2. This makes the non-blue tech path viable by
opening green technologies without needing actual green
prerequisites.</p>
<p>Securing Psychospore R1 is your top priority.</p>
<h3 id="k.-slice-and-draft-considerations">K. Slice and Draft
Considerations</h3>
<p>When drafting your slice and choosing speaker order as Arborec:</p>
<p><strong>Speaker Order:</strong> - <strong>Try to be among the first 3
in speaker order</strong> - Lets you secure key strategy cards
(Technology, Production, Leadership) early. - <strong>If possible, sit
next to a target neighbor</strong> - Position yourself next to a faction
you can pressure or extract value from.</p>
<p><strong>Slice Priorities:</strong> 1. <strong>Fracture
access</strong> - Positioning that lets you reach The Fracture easily.
Fracture provides valuable planets and relics for expansion and
objectives. 2. <strong>Scoring opportunities</strong> - Access to
Mecatol Rex, legendary planets, or objective-friendly systems. You need
points to win. 3. <strong>Tech skip (blue preferred)</strong> - Blue
skip enables the blue tech path (Gravity Drive, Carrier II, Fleet
Logistics), which is your strongest option. Green/red skips can work for
non-blue paths but are less impactful.</p>
<p><strong>Slice Features to Avoid:</strong> - <strong>Asteroid fields
on the way to Mecatol Rex</strong> - Slows movement and disrupts
expansion paths. Very annoying. - <strong>Gravity rifts on the way to
Mecatol Rex</strong> - Complicates your path to MR. Avoid if possible. -
<strong>Empty system tiles near your home</strong> - While infantry in
space can still produce, you’d rather have planets to land on and
control for resources. Empty systems limit your production capacity and
waste slice value.</p>
<p><strong>Neutral/Fine:</strong> - <strong>Entropic Scar</strong> -
Fine but nothing special. Not a priority to seek out. - <strong>Planet
count (4-6 planets)</strong> - Everyone wants high planet counts. Don’t
overprioritize this—focus on skips and resources instead.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iv.-structural-weaknesses">IV. Structural Weaknesses</h2>
<h3 id="a.-first-turn-problems">A. First Turn Problems</h3>
<p>Your R1 is all about setting up your engine. The priority order
is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Breakthrough Expedition</strong> - Secure Psychospore
(R&lt;&gt;G) for mobility and production benefits. This is
mandatory.</li>
<li><strong>Scoring</strong> - Expand to capture 1-3 systems to score
your R1 Stage I objective. Don’t sacrifice your economy for hard
objectives.</li>
<li><strong>Technology</strong> - Begin your tech path if you have
resources available after breakthrough and expansion</li>
<li><strong>Production</strong> - Happens naturally through expansion
and using your space dock. You can produce plenty R2, so don’t stress
this R1.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your ideal R1 involves taking Trade or Leadership, producing from
your home system, securing Psychospore breakthrough, and expanding to
1-3 systems to score objectives.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy Token Usage R1:</strong> You have 2 strategy tokens
R1. Spend them on <strong>Diplomacy</strong> and
<strong>Technology</strong> secondaries if possible. Otherwise, save
them—you don’t need other secondaries R1.</p>
<h3 id="b.-command-counter-scarcity">B. Command Counter Scarcity</h3>
<p>You will burn through command counters producing everywhere.
Leadership becomes one of your best cards. You need 4-5 strategy pool
tokens by R3-4 to really pop off.</p>
<h3 id="c.-slow-start">C. Slow Start</h3>
<p>You don’t score easy R1-R2 points like other factions. Accept this.
Your scoring curve is R3-R5, where you suddenly have the board state to
score 2-3 points per round.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="v.-technology">V. Technology</h2>
<h3 id="a.-overview">A. Overview</h3>
<p><strong>Starting Technology:</strong> Magen Defense Grid (Red) - At
the start of ground combat on a planet that contains 1 or more of your
structures, you may produce 1 hit and assign it to 1 of your opponent’s
ground forces.</p>
<p>You start with <strong>Magen Defense Grid (red)</strong>. Your R1
priority is securing <strong>Psychospore breakthrough expedition
(R&lt;&gt;G)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Synergy:</strong> Psychospore’s R&lt;&gt;G synergy
allows your red and green techs to count as each other for
prerequisites. The breakthrough itself is NOT a tech and does NOT count
as a prerequisite. It simply enables your <strong>Magen Defense Grid
(red)</strong> to count as <strong>green</strong> when researching green
techs, allowing you to get <strong>Letani Warrior II (GG) on R2</strong>
with just 1 green skip!</p>
<p>After securing Psychospore breakthrough R1, your tech path splits
based on objectives and slice.</p>
<h3 id="b.-tech-path-1-blue-path-standard">B. Tech Path 1: Blue Path
(Standard)</h3>
<p>This is your default path. More solid and consistent, prioritizes
mobility and fleet composition.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1:</strong> Sarween Tools (Y) if you teched R1 and have
influence slice (value pick), otherwise skip tech R1 and secure
Psychospore breakthrough only - <strong>Sarween Tools:</strong> When you
use PRODUCTION, reduce the combined cost of produced units by 1</p>
<p><strong>Round 2:</strong> Dark Energy Tap (RR) or Antimass Deflectors
(RR) - Prefer Dark Energy Tap for resources. <strong>With blue
skip:</strong> Can skip this and go Sarween Tools (Y) if greedy, or
straight to Gravity Drive (BB) - <strong>Dark Energy Tap:</strong> After
you perform a tactical action in a system with a frontier token, if you
have ships there, explore that token. Your ships can retreat into
adjacent systems that don’t contain other players’ units -
<strong>Antimass Deflectors:</strong> Your ships can move through
asteroid fields. Apply -1 to SPACE CANNON rolls against your units</p>
<p><strong>Round 3:</strong> Gravity Drive (BB) if you skipped
DET/Antimass, otherwise Carrier II (BBBB) - Magen (counts as blue) +
Gravity Drive (BB) + blue skip - <strong>Gravity Drive:</strong> After
you activate a system, apply +1 to the move value of 1 of your ships
during this tactical action - <strong>Carrier II:</strong> Move 2,
Capacity 6 (upgrade from Move 1, Capacity 4)</p>
<p><strong>Round 4:</strong> Carrier II (BBBB) if skipped R3, otherwise
Fleet Logistics (BB) - <strong>Fleet Logistics:</strong> During each of
your turns in the action phase, you may perform 2 actions instead of
1</p>
<p><strong>Round 5:</strong> Fleet Logistics (BB) if skipped R4,
otherwise flex for objectives</p>
<p><strong>Tech Requirements:</strong> - Yellow skip (for Sarween R1 if
you tech early) - Red skip (helpful but not required) - Green skip
(bonus) - Blue skip (nice): Allows you to skip Dark Energy Tap/Antimass
and go straight to Gravity Drive or take greedy Sarween path</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> - Dark Energy Tap synergizes with spreading
out across the map - Carrier II + Gravity Drive = best mobility in game
- Fleet Logistics enables winning maneuvers late game - Better map
control and expansion - More solid and reliable overall</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> - No Letani Warrior II (skips faction tech
entirely) - Takes until R4 for full power</p>
<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Most situations. Recommended default
path.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="c.-tech-path-2-non-blue-alternative">C. Tech Path 2: Non-Blue
(Alternative)</h3>
<p>Alternative path focused on economy and ground force power. No blue
techs required.</p>
<p><strong>Round 1:</strong> (Secure Psychospore breakthrough - not a
tech!)</p>
<p><strong>Round 2:</strong> Sarween Tools (Y) - Economy boost, stacks
with production spam - <strong>Sarween Tools:</strong> When you use
PRODUCTION, reduce the combined cost of produced units by 1</p>
<p><strong>Round 3:</strong> Biostims (G) - Economy tool that refreshes
planets, doubles your resource/influence output and production
capability - <strong>Bio-Stims:</strong> Exhaust this card at the end of
your turn to ready 1 planet with a technology specialty or 1 of your
other technologies</p>
<p><strong>Round 4:</strong> Destroyer II (RR) - Fleet power -
<strong>Destroyer II:</strong> Cost 1, Combat 8, Move 2, ANTI-FIGHTER
BARRAGE 6 (x3)</p>
<p><strong>Round 5:</strong> Letani Warrior II (GG) if no green skip, OR
X-89 Bacterial Weapon (GGG with green skip only), otherwise flex for
objectives - <strong>Letani Warrior II:</strong> Cost 1 (x2), Combat 7,
PRODUCTION 2. After destroyed, roll 1 die. If 6+, place on this card. At
start of your next turn, place each unit on this card on a planet you
control in your home system - <strong>X-89 Bacterial Weapon:</strong>
After you use BOMBARDMENT against a planet and destroy at least 1
infantry, destroy ALL opponent infantry on that planet</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You may swap Letani Warrior II for a colored
tech if objectives require specific tech colors.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> - Sarween and Biostims provide strong
economy/resource generation - Destroyer II gives fleet combat power -
Can get X-89 R5 with green skip for lethal ground combat - Can get
Letani Warrior II R5 as fallback</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> - Move 1 carriers remain a bottleneck all game
- Less reliable than blue path - Slower than blue path to get mobility -
Delays or skips Letani Warrior II if going X-89 route</p>
<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Unit upgrade strength and massive
production capabilities. Has movement bottleneck but compensates with
stronger ground and fleet combat.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="d.-tech-priorities-by-slice-neighbors">D. Tech Priorities by
Slice &amp; Neighbors</h3>
<p><strong>Resource-Heavy Slice:</strong> Blue path (standard). Dark
Energy Tap requires a few empty systems to be valuable. Slight favor
toward Dreadnought II later since you can afford cost 4 units.</p>
<p><strong>Influence-Heavy Slice + Weak Neighbor:</strong> Non-Blue path
(invasion). Sarween + Biostims economy, Destroyer II affordable with
fleet pool, X-89 for conquering neighbor’s planets.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vi.-strategy-cards">VI. Strategy Cards</h2>
<h3 id="a.-round-one">A. Round One</h3>
<p>Your R1 priority is securing <strong>Psychospore breakthrough
expedition</strong> (R&lt;&gt;G) for command token economy and enabling
your engine. This drives your strategy card choices.</p>
<p><strong>R1 Priority Ranking:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Trade</strong> - You have 3 commodities and desperately
need the economy to fund expansion and securing breakthrough expedition.
Best pick.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Leadership</strong> - Command counters enable more
activations and you need the value. Strong second choice.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Politics</strong> - Agenda control and speaker trading
provide solid value. Can work well if Trade/Leadership are
taken.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Situational but can be useful for
protecting key systems or locking down important tiles.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Technology</strong> - Gets you breakthrough expedition
directly, but risky if you can’t secure Psychospore or if someone takes
Tech first.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Construction</strong> - Problematic because you can only
produce from 1 space dock, limiting your expansion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Warfare</strong> - No longer useful for your R1 game
plan.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Imperial</strong> - Never pick this R1. You’re not
scoring and you don’t want first pick R2.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="b.-generally-r2">B. Generally (R2+)</h3>
<p><strong>Love:</strong> - <strong>Leadership</strong> - Spam
production all turn. This is your best friend R3-R5. -
<strong>Trade</strong> - 3 commodities means 3 TG per refresh. Always
good to have flexible economy. - <strong>Imperial</strong> - You need MR
points. Take this R3-R4 when you can hold MR.</p>
<p><strong>Like:</strong> - <strong>Politics</strong> - Agenda control
is always good. - <strong>Technology</strong> - Staying on your tech
path is valuable and saves you from spending 6 resources to double tech.
Really consider the value of the tech before taking Technology primary -
resources saved aren’t always worth the strategy card slot.</p>
<p><strong>Situational:</strong> - <strong>Diplomacy</strong> - Only
useful R1 or late game for key system lockdowns (note: Mecatol Rex
cannot be locked). Otherwise skip. - <strong>Warfare</strong> - Only
take if you have a specific aggressive play in mind. Otherwise not worth
it.</p>
<p><strong>Hate:</strong> - <strong>Construction</strong> - New
construction primary trolls you (opponents get free structures while you
don’t need them). No need for PDS/production facilities. Only take if
structure objectives force you to.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="vii.-intermediate">VII. Intermediate</h2>
<h3 id="a.-unit-composition">A. Unit Composition</h3>
<p>Your ideal fleet composition in each system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carrier + Fighter screen</strong> - Core of your fleet for
capacity and defense</li>
<li><strong>1 Dreadnought or Flagship</strong> - Critical for getting
hits and adding HP pool to sustain damage</li>
<li><strong>1 Mech</strong> - Protection against bombardment (Planetary
Shield)</li>
<li><strong>Infantry</strong> - Your primary ground force and production
units</li>
</ul>
<p>This composition gives you staying power in space combat
(dread/flagship for hits, fighters for screening), protection against
bombardment (mech), and your signature infantry swarm. Without the
dreadnought/flagship, your fleets lack the punch to get hits in combat
and the HP to survive enemy fire.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have a heavy influence slice, Destroyer
II can replace dreadnoughts in your fleet composition. Heavy influence
gives you more fleet pool to support destroyers, while having less
resources makes dreads (cost 4) harder to afford. Destroyer II becomes
the better choice in this economic profile.</p>
<h3 id="b.-game-plan">B. Game Plan</h3>
<p><strong>Strategic Paths - Mecatol Rex vs Neighbor vs
Fracture:</strong></p>
<p>You have three main strategic paths to choose from R2-R3:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Go for Mecatol Rex</strong> - Your default path. Your
massive infantry production and board presence make you excellent at
holding MR. If you can secure a planet next to Mecatol Rex, build PDS
and infantry to defend approaches.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Attack a Neighbor</strong> - If you have a weak neighbor
or can extract value from pressuring them, use your infantry swarm to
take their planets. Your Letani Warriors have PRODUCTION, so every
planet you take becomes a production facility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fracture Strategy (3rd Option)</strong> - If The Fracture
is in the map and you have an <strong>ingress portal (wormhole) in your
slice</strong>, this can be a bonus opportunity.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>When to Choose Fracture:</strong> - <strong>No one is
grabbing Fracture</strong> (bonus opportunity) - <strong>Mecatol Rex
looks scary</strong> (heavily contested or dangerous) - <strong>No
vulnerable neighbor factions</strong> (everyone around you is
strong)</p>
<p><strong>Fracture Execution:</strong> 1. <strong>Move to
Fracture</strong> (first movement) 2. <strong>Use breakthrough to move
again</strong> (second movement - exploring happens at the end of this
movement to grab the relic)</p>
<p><strong>Prefer the 2-planet/relic side</strong> over the 1-planet
side, but both work depending on board state.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> This strategy is risky. You become a target
while “in the air” and you’ll have many ships stuck in The Fracture
system. Only execute this if you can defend your position or if the
relic/planets are worth the exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Custodians Token / Mecatol Rex:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Strongly advised against grabbing the Custodians token
R2.</strong> This is very risky for Arborec because it impacts your
economy (you need resources R2-R3 to build your engine), hurts scoring
(can’t score Stage I objectives while holding Custodians), and makes you
a target when you’re still weak.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended approach:</strong> Let someone else take
Custodians R2. Build up your infantry swarm R2-R3, then take Mecatol Rex
from them R3-R4. When you take it from another player using Imperial,
you score 1 point for controlling MR plus 1 bonus point for taking it
from another player = 2 points total.</p>
<p><strong>Key principle:</strong> When you enter Mecatol Rex, you don’t
want to lose it. Only take MR when you can hold it with overwhelming
infantry and mechs (8-12+ ground forces). Your defensive strength comes
from massing units, not early aggression.</p>
<p><strong>Styx Consideration:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Styx is out of range for non-blue tech path</strong> but
becomes <strong>viable with blue tech path</strong> (Gravity Drive +
Fleet Logistics). It can serve as a late-game guaranteed point for
objectives like “Become a Legend” or other anomaly/legendary planet
objectives.</p>

<p><strong>Legend:</strong> 🟢 Likely | 🟡 Possible | 🔴 Difficult</p>
<p>Arborec is one of the best control objective factions in the game.
You will naturally have 8-12 planets by R4-R5.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="ix.-alliance-priority">IX. Alliance Priority</h2>
<p>Trading for other factions’ Alliance promissory notes (which give you
access to their Commanders) can significantly boost your strategy. Here
are the top alliances to prioritize:</p>
<p><strong>Super Top Tier:</strong> 1. <strong>Titans of Ul
(Tungstantus)</strong> - When you use PRODUCTION, gain 1 trade good.
Perfect synergy with constant production. 2. <strong>Nomad (Navarch
Feng)</strong> - Produce your flagship without spending resources.
Always good value (saves 8 resources). 3. <strong>Winnu (Rickar
Rickani)</strong> - Apply +2 to combat rolls in Mecatol Rex, your home
system, and legendary planet systems. Great combat boost. 4.
<strong>Sardakk N’orr (G’hom Sek’kus)</strong> - During Commit Ground
Forces, commit 1 ground force from each planet in active/adjacent
systems. Invasion flexibility with your infantry swarm.</p>
<p><strong>Really Useful:</strong> 5. <strong>Deepwrought
(Aello)</strong> - When you research tech, reduce cost by 1 resource.
More money for production. 6. <strong>Naaz-Rokha (Dart and Tai)</strong>
- After you gain control of a planet from another player, explore that
planet. Good for conquest plays. 7. <strong>Muaat (Magmus)</strong> -
After you spend token from strategy pool, gain 1 trade good. Good
economy boost. 8. <strong>Saar (Rowl Sarring)</strong> - When you
produce fighters/infantry, place them at ANY of your space docks.
Flexibility for spreading units. 9. <strong>Empyrean (Xuange)</strong> -
After another player moves ships into system with your token, return
token to reinforcements. Late game slaying.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="x.-end-notes">X. End Notes</h2>
<p>Arborec is a powerhouse disguised as a slow faction. Expand
aggressively R1-R2 (preferably 6+ planets), decide on your path R2-R3
(Mecatol Rex or neighbor pressure), get Imperial R3/4 to maintain
scoring tempo, use your Hero R4 to build a massive army across multiple
systems, and adapt R5 to solve whatever situation comes at you with your
overwhelming production.</p>
<p>Don’t let anyone tell you Arborec is weak. You’re an S-tier control
faction with unmatched production potential. Play patient, play smart,
and grow your forest across the galaxy.</p>
