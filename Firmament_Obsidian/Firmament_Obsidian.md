# The Firmament / The Obsidian Comprehensive Strategy Guide

## I. Introduction

The Firmament / The Obsidian are Twilight Imperium's **dual-faction transformation powerhouse**, the only faction that fundamentally changes identity mid-game. You begin as **The Firmament**, a shadow manipulator that scores other players' secret objectives without gaining points, instead collecting plot cards that grant powerful abilities against those "puppeted" players. When you choose, you transform into **The Obsidian**, a military juggernaut whose home planets become hollow (3/0 resource each, totaling 6 resources), all plots flip to revealed status unleashing their effects, and your faction components upgrade to aggressive versions. This faction rewards strategic deception, perfect transformation timing, and understanding both phases of your dual nature. No other faction plays two completely different games in sequence.

## II. Playstyle

**Early Game as The Firmament (Rounds 1-3):**
Your opening focuses on identifying which secret objectives opponents will score and positioning yourself to score them for plot cards instead of points. Use Plots within Plots to score secrets already scored by others—when you do, you gain a facedown plot card with that player's control token on it rather than victory points. This makes you appear behind on the scoreboard (critical for staying under the radar) while accumulating hidden power. Your starting technology choice (green or yellow with no prerequisites) determines your tech path: Neural Parasite (green) for infantry generation or Sarween Tools (yellow) for economic efficiency. Your commander (Captain Aroz) unlocks with just 1 plot card, allowing you to treat planets in systems with your ships as controlled for scoring purposes—making it easier to score opponent secrets. Trade your Black Ops promissory note to gain a free plot card from a chosen player.

**Mid-Game Transformation Decision (Rounds 3-4):**
This is the critical inflection point. You need at least 1 plot to transform via Puppets of the Blade, but ideally you want 3-4 plots before triggering transformation. Each plot provides unique abilities: Assail (+1 combat vs that player), Enervate (free strategy secondaries from them), Extract (steal their technologies), Seethe (destroy their units), or Siphon (gain trade goods when they gain commodities). Transformation timing is everything: too early and you miss plot opportunities; too late and you can't leverage Obsidian's power to score victory points. Consider transformation when: (1) You have 3-4 plots, (2) You're at 2-4 victory points (far enough behind not to be targeted), (3) Stage II objectives appear that favor military/resources, (4) Opponents have secured enough secrets that future plot opportunities diminish.

**Late Game as The Obsidian (Rounds 4-6+):**
After transformation, your entire faction changes. Your home planets flip to Cronos Hollow and Tallin Hollow (3/0 each = 6 total resources, 0 influence), your plots flip to revealed status activating their abilities simultaneously, and all your dual-sided components upgrade. You become a resource-rich military faction with 6 home resources, superior flagship (3 dice instead of 2), offensive agent (forces mutual ship destruction), and combat-focused commander (Aroz Hollow grants +1 combat in The Fracture). Your Neural Parasite tech (if researched) flips from generating friendly infantry to destroying enemy infantry. Your breakthrough flips from storing trade goods (The Sowing) to generating them from combat victories and doubling them (The Reaping). Victory comes from leveraging your resource advantage to field massive fleets, using plot abilities to dominate specific opponents, and scoring objectives rapidly with your accumulated board presence.

## III. The Basics

### A. Home System & Commodities

**The Firmament Home System:**
- **Cronos:** 2 resources, 1 influence
- **Tallin:** 1 resource, 2 influence
- **Total:** 3 resources / 3 influence (2 optimal resources / 2 optimal influence)

**The Obsidian Home System (After Transformation):**
- **Cronos Hollow:** 3 resources, 0 influence
- **Tallin Hollow:** 3 resources, 0 influence
- **Total:** 6 resources / 0 influence (6 optimal resources / 0 optimal influence)

**Critical Notes:**
- Transformation DOUBLES your home resources (3 → 6)
- Transformation ELIMINATES your home influence (3 → 0)
- When you transform and The Blade's Orchestra triggers, Cronos Hollow and Tallin Hollow ready if you control them
- This gives you 6 fresh resources immediately upon transformation
- Post-transformation influence poverty makes politics extremely difficult

**Commodities:** 3
- Average commodity economy
- Neither Firmament nor Obsidian are trade-focused
- Siphon plot can supplement income if you puppet a high-commodity faction (Hacan, Winnu)

**Optimal Resource/Influence from Home Worlds:**
- **Firmament:** 2 optimal resources / 2 optimal influence
- **Obsidian:** 6 optimal resources / 0 optimal influence
- The transformation represents the single largest economic swing of any faction ability in the game

### B. Starting Fleet

**1 Carrier:**
- Standard capacity 6 carrier
- Transports your 3 starting infantry
- Critical for invasions to score opponent secrets

**1 Cruiser:**
- Standard cruiser (cost 2, combat 7, move 2)
- Fast screening unit
- Helps reach distant systems for secret objective scoring

**1 Destroyer:**
- Standard destroyer (cost 1, combat 9, anti-fighter barrage)
- Screening and combat support
- Affordable fleet expansion

**3 Fighters:**
- Standard space combat fodder
- Screen your capital ships
- Expandable with production

**3 Infantry:**
- Standard ground force complement
- Critical for planet control to score secrets
- Neural Parasite tech generates more if researched

**1 Space Dock:**
- Already built at your home system
- Produce additional ships and ground forces
- Essential for building invasion fleets to score secrets

### C. Faction Abilities

**Plots within Plots (The Firmament):**
*You can score secret objectives already scored by other players if you fulfill their requirements; this does not count against your secret objective limit or the number you can score in a round. When you score another player's secret objective, do not gain a victory point; instead, place a facedown plot card into your play area with that player's control token on it.*

- Score secrets other players have ALREADY scored
- Does NOT gain you victory points (you appear behind on scoreboard)
- Does NOT count against your secret limit (can score your own secret + multiple opponent secrets in one round)
- Gain facedown plot card with that player's control token
- Plot cards have powerful abilities once revealed (after transformation)
- Core mechanic: trade victory points now for power later

**Puppets of the Blade (The Firmament):**
*If you have at least 1 plot card in your play area, gain the following ability: ACTION: Purge The Firmament's faction sheet, leaders, planet cards, and promissory note. Then, gain all of the faction components for The Obsidian.*

- Requires at least 1 plot card
- Costs an ACTION (full turn)
- PURGES all Firmament components permanently
- Gains all Obsidian components
- Irreversible transformation
- Timing is critical: balance plot accumulation vs. scoring window

**Nocturne (The Obsidian):**
*This faction cannot be chosen during setup.*

- The Obsidian cannot be selected at game start
- Only appears through Firmament transformation
- Thematic: Obsidian is the "blade revealed" version of Firmament

**The Blade's Orchestra (The Obsidian):**
*When this faction comes into play, flip your home system, double-sided faction components, and all of your in-play plot cards. Then, ready Cronos Hollow and Tallin Hollow if you control them.*

- Triggers when you transform
- Flips home planets to hollow versions (2/1 + 1/2 → 3/0 + 3/0)
- Flips all dual-sided components (agent, commander, hero, promissory note, mech, flagship, faction techs, breakthrough)
- Flips ALL plot cards from facedown to revealed (activating their abilities)
- Readies hollow planets if you control them (6 fresh resources)

**Marionettes (Both Factions):**
*The player or players whose control tokens are on each plot card are the puppeted players for that plot.*

- Defines who is "puppeted" for plot abilities
- Each plot targets the player whose secret you scored
- Can have multiple plots targeting the same player
- Puppeted status matters for plot effects and flagship bonuses

### D. Starting and Faction Technologies

**Starting Technologies:**

**Choose ONE Green or Yellow Technology with No Prerequisites:**

This is a critical Round 1 decision that shapes your entire tech path.

**Green Technologies:**
- **Bio-Stims (G)** - Exhaust to sacrifice infantry for command tokens
- **Hyper Metabolism (GG)** - Gain 3 command tokens instead of 2 during status phase
- **X-89 Bacterial Weapon (GGG)** - Bombardment ignores planetary shields, destroys all infantry after invasion

**Yellow Technologies:**
- **Sarween Tools** - +1 fighter/infantry per production (most common choice)
- **Neural Motivator** - +1 command token per status phase
- **Graviton Laser System** - PDS rolls +1 die for space cannon

**Recommended Choices:**
1. **Sarween Tools (Yellow)** - Economic efficiency for infantry spam (helps score ground-based secrets)
2. **Hyper Metabolism (Green)** - Command token sustainability for aggressive expansion
3. **Bio-Stims (Green)** - Opens path to Neural Parasite (GG), synergizes with infantry production

**Faction Technologies:**

(Add faction technology information here if available from the cheat sheet)

### E. Leaders

**Agent: Myru Vos (The Firmament)**
*When a player moves ships: You may exhaust this card; if you do, SPACE CANNON cannot be used against those ships. If they are not transporting units, they can also move through other players' ships.*

- Exhausts when ANY player moves ships
- Grants space cannon immunity to those ships
- If ships NOT transporting units, they can move through opponent ships
- Defensive/mobility tool
- Can be traded to other players for favors

**Agent: Vos Hollow (The Obsidian)**
*When a player's ship is destroyed during any combat: You may exhaust this card; if you do, that player's opponent must destroy 1 of their ships of the same type in the active system.*

- Exhausts when ANY player's ship destroyed in combat
- Forces that player's OPPONENT to destroy matching ship
- Example: Player A's destroyer dies → Player B must destroy one of their destroyers
- Devastating in combat: forces mutual destruction
- Punishes opponents fighting each other (you benefit from their losses)

**Commander: Captain Aroz (The Firmament)**
*Unlock: Have a plot card in play.*
*You may treat planets in systems that contain your ships as if you controlled them for the purpose of scoring secret objectives.*

- Unlock: 1 plot card (very easy—happens Round 1-2)
- Treat planets with your ships as "controlled" for secrets
- Does NOT actually give you control (can't produce, exhaust, etc.)
- Only for SECRET OBJECTIVE scoring
- Example: Secret requires "control 3 cultural planets" → ships in systems with cultural planets count
- Dramatically easier to score opponent secrets

**Commander: Aroz Hollow (The Obsidian)**
*Unlock: Have units in The Fracture.*
*Apply +1 to the result of each of your units' combat rolls in The Fracture.*

- Unlock: Units in The Fracture (system tile added via Planesplitter tech)
- +1 to ALL combat rolls in The Fracture (space and ground)
- Stacks with Assail plot (+1 vs puppeted player) for +2 total
- Makes The Fracture your fortress system
- Encourages building/holding The Fracture

**Hero: Sharsiss (The Firmament)**
*Unlock: Have 3 scored objectives.*
*The blade beckons:*
*ACTION: Place 1 of your plot cards in play with any other player's control token on it. Then, you may place any player's control token on 1 of your in-play plot cards; one plot cannot have two of the same player's tokens. Then, purge this card.*

- One-time-use ability
- Gain 1 free plot targeting any player (even if you haven't scored their secret)
- Can reassign existing plot to different player
- Cannot have 2 plots with same player's token on one plot
- Use to gain plot against player whose secret you couldn't score
- Or reassign plot to more threatening opponent

**Hero: Sharsiss Hollow (The Obsidian)**
*Unlock: Have 3 scored objectives.*
*The blade revealed:*
*ACTION: Ready all of your planets. Then, purge this card.*

- One-time-use ability
- Ready ALL planets you control (not just home)
- With 6-resource hollow home, this is massive economic burst
- Use to fund War Sun, mass production, or technology research
- Timing: when you need sudden resource injection for critical build

### F. Promissory Note

**Black Ops (The Firmament):**
*When you receive this card, if you are not the Firmament: The Firmament player may place 1 facedown plot card in their play area with your control token on it. Then, gain 2 command tokens, gain 2 trade goods, and purge this card.*

- When another player receives this note from you
- You gain a free plot with their control token
- They gain 2 command tokens + 2 trade goods
- Card purges after use
- Excellent transaction value: trade for support/favors while gaining plot
- Choose which player to give it to strategically (target player with strong commander, high commodities, or military threat)

**Malevolency (The Obsidian):**
*At the end of one of your tactical actions: Spend 1 influence to give this card to one of your neighbors; you can use this ability even if you are the Obsidian player. At the end of the status phase, if you are not the Obsidian player, remove 1 command token from your fleet pool and return it to your reinforcements.*

- At end of tactical action, spend 1 influence to pass this to neighbor
- Holder loses 1 fleet token at end of EVERY status phase
- Drains opponent's fleet capacity over time
- Powerful disruption tool
- Pass to high-fleet-capacity opponents (carriers, dreadnoughts)

### G. Alliance

**Alliance Ability (The Firmament):**
*While you are neighbors with the Firmament player, you gain the following alliance ability:*
*Plots within Plots - You can score secret objectives already scored by other players if you fulfill their requirements; this does not count against your secret objective limit or the number you can score in a round. When you score another player's secret objective, do not gain a victory point; instead, place a facedown plot card into your play area with that player's control token on it.*

- Grants Plots within Plots to ally
- Ally can also score opponent secrets for plots
- Creates dual plot-gathering faction dynamic
- Very powerful for coordinated strategies

**Alliance Ability (The Obsidian):**
*While you are neighbors with the Obsidian player, you gain the following alliance ability:*
*(Typically extends Obsidian benefits, but specific text not detailed in standard references)*

- Grants Obsidian-related benefits to ally
- Neighbor must be adjacent to your units/controlled systems

### H. Mech

**Viper Ex-23 (The Firmament):**
*Cost: 2*
*Combat: 6*
*Sustain Damage*
*When ground forces are committed to this planet, you may choose for your units to coexist, if they were not already. Flip this card if your faction becomes the Obsidian.*

- Standard mech combat 6 with Sustain Damage
- When opponent invades planet with this mech, you can choose COEXISTENCE
- Coexistence = both players' ground forces exist on planet without fighting
- Neither controls planet while coexisting
- Defensive stalling tactic
- Card flips when you transform to Obsidian

**Viper Ex-23 (The Obsidian):**
*Cost: 2*
*Combat: 6*
*Sustain Damage*
*If this unit was coexisting when this card flipped to this side, gain control of its planet; the other player's units are now coexisting.*

- Same stats
- **Triggered ability**: If this mech was coexisting when you transformed, you TAKE CONTROL of the planet
- Original controller's units now coexist with YOU (they don't control it)
- Devastating surprise planet theft
- Strategy: Use Firmament mech to coexist on valuable planets, then transform to steal them
- Opponents lose planet control without combat

### I. Flagship

**Heaven's Eye (The Firmament):**
*Cost: 8*
*Combat: 5 (x2)*
*Move: 1*
*Capacity: 3*
*Sustain Damage*
*If the active system contains units that belong to a player who has a control token on 1 of your plots, apply +1 to this ship's move value and repair it at the end of every combat round.*

- 2 dice at combat 5
- +1 movement when fighting puppeted players (move 2)
- Self-repairs at end of every combat round vs puppeted players
- Sustainable in prolonged battles
- Capacity 3 for ground force transport

**Heaven's Hollow (The Obsidian):**
*Cost: 8*
*Combat: 5 (x3)*
*Move: 1*
*Capacity: 3*
*Sustain Damage*

- 3 dice at combat 5 (upgraded from 2 dice)
- Loses conditional movement/repair but gains permanent extra die
- Better raw combat power
- Capacity 3 for ground forces

### J. Breakthrough

**The Sowing (The Firmament - Yellow <> Green):**
*When you gain this card and at the start of the status phase, you may place up to 3 of your trade goods on this card. Flip this card if you become the Obsidian faction.*

- Bank up to 3 trade goods on this card
- Can add more each status phase (up to 3 total stored)
- Stores trade goods for transformation
- When you transform, this card flips

**The Reaping (The Obsidian - Yellow <> Green):**
*Place 1 trade good from the supply onto this card each time you win a combat against a puppeted player. At the start of the status phase, gain all trade goods on this card, then gain an equal number of trade goods from the supply.*

- Win combat vs puppeted player → +1 trade good on card
- At status phase, gain all trade goods on card
- Then gain EQUAL amount from supply (doubles them)
- Example: 4 trade goods on card → gain 4, then gain 4 more = 8 total
- Massive economic engine if fighting puppeted players frequently
- Synergizes with multiple plots

### K. Slice Considerations

**Critical Priorities:**

1. **Balanced Economy (Pre-Transformation):**
   - Firmament needs 3/3 from home + slice resources/influence
   - Target 10-12 resources, 8-10 influence total before transformation
   - After transformation, you have 6 resources but 0 influence
   - Need influence-rich slice to compensate post-transformation influence poverty

2. **Secret Objective Diversity:**
   - Need access to multiple planet types (cultural, hazardous, industrial) to score diverse secrets
   - Exploration opportunities for "explore 3 planets" type secrets
   - Access to other players' slices to score "control planet in opponent home system" secrets

3. **The Fracture Access:**
   - Planesplitter tech puts The Fracture into play (anomaly system)
   - Obsidian commander requires units in The Fracture
   - Ideal slice has positioning to reach/control The Fracture easily

4. **Technology Specialties:**
   - Yellow (cybernetic) for Planesplitter (YY) and The Sowing breakthrough
   - Green (biotic) for Neural Parasite (GG) and The Sowing breakthrough
   - Industrial/hazardous planets support diverse tech paths

**Ideal Slice Characteristics:**
- 10-12 resources, 8-10 influence (after home)
- 2-3 planet types (cultural/hazardous/industrial mix) for secret diversity
- 1-2 yellow/green technology specialties
- Moderate Mecatol proximity (you can score it via secrets, then hold after transformation)
- Positioning allowing access to multiple opponents' territories (easier to score their secrets)

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

### A. First Turn Priorities

As Firmament/Obsidian, your first turn priorities depend on whether you're in Firmament phase (Rounds 1-3) or post-transformation Obsidian phase (Rounds 4+).

**As The Firmament (Early Game):**

1. **Scoring** - Your Plots within Plots ability requires scoring OPPONENT secrets without gaining points. Identify which secrets opponents will score (explore-based, territorial, tech-based) and position to score them for plot cards. Commander unlocks with just 1 plot, treating planets in systems with your ships as controlled for secrets.

2. **Expansion + Production** - You need board presence to score opponent secrets. Expand to 2-3 systems Round 1. Your starting tech choice (green or yellow) determines your path: Sarween Tools for economic efficiency or Bio-Stims/Hyper Metabolism for sustainability.

3. **Technology** - Push toward Neural Parasite (generates friendly infantry as Firmament, destroys enemy infantry as Obsidian) or production techs. However, plot collection comes first—tech supports plot acquisition.

4. **Breakthrough** - The Sowing/Reaping (stores trade goods pre-transformation, generates + doubles them post-transformation) is powerful but requires transformation timing. Focus on plot collection first.

**As The Obsidian (Post-Transformation):**

Priority shifts completely: your 6-resource home system, revealed plots, and aggressive components make you a military powerhouse. Focus on rapid scoring to overcome point deficit from Firmament phase.

**1. Victory Point Deficit:**
Scoring opponent secrets for plots gives you NO victory points. You appear behind on the scoreboard for the entire Firmament phase, creating massive point deficit. If you collect 4 plots (Rounds 1-3), you might be at 0-2 points while leaders are at 4-6 points. You must catch up rapidly after transformation, requiring perfect execution in Obsidian phase.

**2. Transformation Timing Pressure:**
Deciding WHEN to transform is the hardest decision in TI4. Transform too early (Round 2 with 1-2 plots) and you miss plot opportunities and enter Obsidian phase weak. Transform too late (Round 5 with 6 plots) and you can't score enough points as Obsidian to win. The "Goldilocks window" is typically Round 3-4 with 3-4 plots, but this varies by game state.

**3. Dependency on Opponent Secret Draws:**
Plots within Plots only works if opponents score secrets you can also achieve. If opponents draw secrets incompatible with your board state (military secrets when you're peaceful, exploration secrets when you're boxed in), you can't gain plots. Bad opponent secret luck cripples your faction.

**4. Influence Poverty Post-Transformation:**
Hollow planets give 0 influence. After transformation, you have 0 home influence, making politics nearly impossible. You cannot spend influence for objectives, vote meaningfully in agendas, or compete with influence-rich factions (Xxcha, Hacan, Winnu) unless you expand to influence-heavy planets.

**5. Plot Randomization:**
Plot cards are drawn randomly when you score opponent secrets. You don't choose which plot you get—it's random from the 5 plot types (Assail, Enervate, Extract, Seethe, Siphon). Bad plot draws (getting Siphon against a 2-commodity faction, or Enervate against an opponent who never picks valuable strategy cards) waste plot slots.

**6. Commander Unlock Divergence:**
Firmament commander (Captain Aroz) requires plots; Obsidian commander (Aroz Hollow) requires units in The Fracture. These are completely different unlock conditions. You unlock Firmament commander Round 1-2 easily, but Obsidian commander requires researching Planesplitter (YY) and moving units to The Fracture, often not until Round 4-5.

**7. Complex Gameplay:**
Managing dual faction sheets, tracking 5 different plot types, timing transformation, and executing two different strategies in sequence creates extreme cognitive load. This is TI4's most complicated faction. Mistakes in plot prioritization or transformation timing lose games.

**8. Alliance Note Purging:**
When you transform, your Firmament promissory note (Black Ops) purges. If you haven't traded it yet, you lose that opportunity. Similarly, all Firmament faction components purge permanently. Any faction-specific advantages (Firmament agent uses, commander benefits) disappear forever.

- Command token sustainability

## VI. Strategy Cards

### A. Round 1 (as The Firmament)

Your R1 priority is scoring opponent secrets and accumulating plots while avoiding your own victory points.

**Round 1 Priority Ranking:**

1. **Technology** - Need Planesplitter (YY) and Neural Parasite (GG). Early tech advantage accelerates plot accumulation.

2. **Politics** - Speaker token valuable, action card draw excellent. 3 starting influence makes politics viable.

3. **Construction** - Space docks for distributed production, PDS for defense. Supports expansion for secret scoring.

4. **Leadership** - Command tokens help aggressive expansion to score secrets. Not top priority but useful.

5. **Warfare** - Remove tokens, redistribute fleets. Useful for invasions to score opponent secrets.

6. **Trade** - 3 commodities is average. Trade your Black Ops PN this round to gain plot + support.

7. **Diplomacy** - Planet readying less valuable early. Not holding Mecatol Round 1 typically.

8. **Imperial** - You DON'T WANT victory points as Firmament. Scoring your own secrets gains points but doesn't help plot accumulation. Avoid.

### B. Round 2+

**As The Firmament (Rounds 2-3):**

**Love:**
- **Technology** - Push toward Planesplitter, Neural Parasite, breakthrough. Essential for plot engine.
- **Politics** - Speaker control, action card draw, influence advantage for agendas.

**Like:**
- **Construction** - Space docks for production and expansion infrastructure.
- **Warfare** - When you need to invade/contest to score opponent secrets.
- **Trade** - Continue trading Black Ops PN for plots and support.

**Situational:**
- **Leadership** - Command tokens for expansion if needed.

**Transformation Round (Round 3-4):**
Typically use your action to transform (Puppets of the Blade). May not get strategy card this round.

**As The Obsidian (Rounds 4-6+):**

**Love:**
- **Imperial** - NOW you want victory points. Prioritize scoring.
- **Warfare** - Military aggression and Mecatol control.
- **Construction** - Leverage 6-resource hollow planets for massive builds.

**Like:**
- **Leadership** - Command tokens for sustained aggression.
- **Technology** - Continue tech path if needed.
- **Trade** - 3 commodities for economic support.

## VII. Intermediate

### A. Unit Composition

**Early Game Fleet as Firmament (Rounds 1-2):**
- 1-2 Carriers (transport infantry for invasions)
- 2-3 Cruisers (fast movement to reach opponent territories)
- 2-3 Destroyers (screening, anti-fighter)
- 4-6 Fighters (screening)
- 10-15 Infantry (mass invasions to score ground-based secrets)
- 2 Space Docks (home + 1 forward)
- 0-1 PDS

**Mid Game Fleet as Firmament (Rounds 2-3):**
- 2-3 Carriers (capacity for infantry)
- 3-4 Cruisers (mobility for secret scoring)
- 3-4 Destroyers (screening)
- 6-8 Fighters (screening)
- 15-20 Infantry (sustained invasions; Neural Parasite generates more)
- 2-3 Space Docks
- 1-2 PDS
- 0-1 Flagship (if resources permit)

**Post-Transformation Fleet as Obsidian (Rounds 4-5):**
- 3-4 Carriers
- 4-6 Cruisers OR 2-3 Dreadnoughts (shift to combat focus)
- 4-6 Destroyers
- 8-10 Fighters
- 16-20 Infantry
- 3-4 Space Docks

**Key Principles:**
- **Firmament Phase:** Mobility and infantry spam to score secrets
- **Obsidian Phase:** Military power leveraging 6-resource home economy
- Mechs for planet control (coexist → steal on transformation)
- Flagship gains extra die after transformation

### C. Game Plan

**Round 1 (as The Firmament):**
- **Strategy Card:** Technology (7) or Politics (3)
- **Starting Tech:** Choose Sarween Tools OR Hyper Metabolism
- **Expansion:** Claim 2-3 systems, prioritize diverse planet types for secret flexibility
- **Plot Setup:** Identify which opponents will score which secrets
- **Commander Unlock:** Watch for opportunity to score opponent secret for first plot (unlocks Captain Aroz)
- **Trade:** Offer Black Ops PN to player whose secret you can easily score (gain plot + 2 command tokens/2 trade goods for them)

**Round 2 (as The Firmament):**
- **Strategy Card:** Technology (7) or Construction (4)
- **Objectives:** Score 1 public objective, score 1-2 opponent secrets for plots
- **Tech:** Work toward Planesplitter (YY) or Neural Parasite (GG)
- **Plot Accumulation:** Target 2-3 plots total by end of round
- **Positioning:** Position ships near opponent territories to use Captain Aroz (treat systems as controlled)

**Round 3 (as The Firmament):**
- **Strategy Card:** Technology (7) or Politics (3)
- **Objectives:** Score 1 more public, attempt 1 more plot
- **Tech:** Complete Planesplitter OR Neural Parasite
- **Plot Goal:** 3-4 plots total
- **Transformation Decision:** Assess if ready to transform Round 4

**Round 4 (Transformation Round → become The Obsidian):**
- **Action:** Use Puppets of the Blade to transform
- **Immediate Effects:**
  - Home planets flip to hollow (6 resources readied)
  - All plots flip to revealed (activate abilities)
  - All components flip (agent, commander, flagship, etc.)
- **Strategy Card:** Imperial (8) if available post-transformation
- **Objectives:** Score 2-3 objectives leveraging plot abilities
- **Build:** Use 6 fresh resources to produce massive fleet
- **Plot Leverage:** Use revealed plots (Assail for combat, Enervate for free secondaries, Extract for tech theft, Seethe for unit destruction, Siphon for trade goods)

**Round 5 (as The Obsidian):**
- **Strategy Card:** Imperial (8) or Warfare (6)
- **Objectives:** Score Stage II objectives (leverage resource advantage)
- **Hero:** If unlocked (3 scored objectives), use Sharsiss Hollow to ready all planets for economic burst
- **Commander:** Move units to The Fracture, unlock Aroz Hollow (+1 combat there)
- **The Reaping:** Win combats vs puppeted players to accumulate trade goods (doubled at status phase)
- **Expansion:** Control 10+ planets via military conquest

**Round 6+ (as The Obsidian):**
- **Endgame:** Close out victory through military dominance
- **Imperial:** Hold Mecatol for scoring
- **Plot Abuse:** Stack plot abilities (fight puppeted players with Assail, use Enervate for free secondaries, copy techs with Extract)
- **Resource Advantage:** 6-resource hollow home + captured planets = 15+ resources for War Suns, mass production
- **Close Out:** Reach 10-14 points through rapid Stage II scoring

## VIII. Objectives

### A. Objective Summary

**Strengths:** Firmament/Obsidian excels at tech objectives with strong research focus and flexible tech paths. Plots within Plots ability enables scoring opponent secret objectives, and revealed plots provide additional objective scoring opportunities through asymmetric information.

**Weaknesses:** Planet control objectives require more effort without natural expansion bonuses. Combat objectives are challenging in Firmament phase without military focus, though Obsidian phase improves combat capability significantly.

**Note:** Firmament Obsidian's dual-phase nature makes objective difficulty vary significantly. Ratings below reflect Obsidian phase (post-transformation).

**Legend:** 🟢 Likely | 🟡 Possible | 🔴 Difficult

Firmament gains plots by scoring opponent secrets. Obsidian leverages 6-resource hollow home and revealed plots for rapid scoring.

## IX. Alliance Priority

Your alliance ability grants Plots within Plots (Firmament) or Obsidian benefits to allies. Trade carefully based on which phase you're in.

**High-Value Alliance Partners (as Firmament):**
1. **Intelligence-Gathering Factions:**
   - **Nomad:** Can reach distant systems to score diverse secrets
   - **Ghosts of Creuss:** Mobility enables scoring varied opponent secrets
   - **Naalu Collective:** 0 initiative helps score secrets early

2. **Plot-Synergy Factions:**
   - Factions that benefit from also gaining plots (coordinated dual-plot strategy)

**High-Value Alliance Partners (as Obsidian):**
1. **Aggressive War Factions:**
   - **Sardakk N'orr:** Benefits from shared military bonuses
   - **L1Z1X Mindnet:** Dreadnought synergy
   - **Barony of Letnev:** Military alliance

**What to Demand in Exchange:**
- **Economic Support:** Trade goods, commodities
- **Political Support:** Votes on agendas (critical post-transformation with 0 influence)
- **Military Support:** Joint wars vs puppeted players (leverage Assail plots)
- **Territory Agreements:** Access to opponent territories to score secrets

**Timing Considerations:**
- **Pre-Transformation:** Alliance less valuable (you're weak)
- **Post-Transformation:** Alliance very valuable (you're strong, 6-resource economy)

## X. Bonus Game Elements

This section highlights action cards that synergize particularly well with your faction's strengths or mitigate your weaknesses, relics that offer exceptional value for your faction's strategy and abilities, and agendas to pursue that benefit your position, and agendas to watch out for that could hurt you.

## XI. End Notes

The Firmament / The Obsidian are Twilight Imperium's **most unique and strategically complex faction**, demanding mastery of two completely different playstyles in sequence. Your success depends on **perfect transformation timing, strategic plot accumulation, and ruthless Obsidian-phase execution**.

**Key Principles for Success:**

1. **Score Opponent Secrets Strategically:** Target secrets from players you'll want to puppet. Assail against military threats, Siphon against high-commodity factions, Extract against tech leaders.

2. **Transform at the Right Moment:** Ideal window is Round 3-4 with 3-4 plots. Too early = weak Obsidian; too late = insufficient scoring window.

3. **Leverage Captain Aroz:** Firmament commander lets you treat systems with ships as controlled for secrets. Use this to score opponent secrets without actually conquering planets.

4. **Trade Black Ops PN Wisely:** Choose which player gets it based on whose secret you can easily score. Gain free plot while giving them resources/command tokens.

5. **Plan Mech Coexistence:** Use Firmament mechs to coexist on valuable planets, then transform to STEAL those planets. Devastating surprise tactic.

6. **Maximize Hollow Planet Economy:** 6 resources from home post-transformation is massive. Build War Suns, mass dreadnoughts, or rapid expansion fleets immediately.

7. **Stack Plot Abilities:** With 3-4 revealed plots, you can have Assail (+1 combat) against one player, Enervate (free secondaries) against another, Extract (tech theft) against a third. Use all simultaneously.

8. **The Reaping Economic Engine:** Win combats vs puppeted players → gain trade goods → double them at status phase. Massive economic snowball.

9. **Accept Influence Poverty:** Post-transformation, 0 influence is permanent. Expand to influence planets immediately or accept political irrelevance.

10. **Hero Timing:** Firmament hero (Sharsiss) gains free plot or reassigns plots. Obsidian hero (Sharsiss Hollow) readies all planets. Use whichever phase's hero fits your needs.

The Firmament / Obsidian rewards **strategic deception, perfect timing, and deep understanding of secret objectives**. You play an entirely different game than opponents—accumulating hidden power while appearing weak, then transforming into a juggernaut. Master plot accumulation timing, transformation decision-making, and Obsidian aggression to dominate through this unique dual-faction identity.

**The shadow becomes the blade. All will fall before The Obsidian.**
