# Yin Brotherhood Guide

![Yin Brotherhood](YinArt.webp)

---

## I. Introduction

The Yin Brotherhood are the most sacrificial faction in TI4. This faction excels at kamikaze destroyer attacks through Devotion, stealing planets via Indoctrination, and spawning units from nothing through their Yin Spinner faction tech. Yin isn't about preserving units—it's about trading efficiently, using deaths as fuel for expansion, and understanding when self-sacrifice creates more value than survival.

The payoff? Watching opponents realize your "weak" destroyer just guaranteed-killed their dreadnought, seeing infantry spawn from nowhere to invade undefended planets, and converting enemy ground forces to your side mid-combat. When you master trading down in cost but up in value, every space battle becomes a net win even when you "lose."

## II. Playstyle

Playing Yin Brotherhood is like being a tactical suicide bomber with perfect math. Your Devotion ability lets you destroy your own destroyers/cruisers to deal guaranteed hits, your Indoctrination converts enemy infantry to yours for 2 influence, and your Yin Spinner tech spawns 2 infantry anywhere after production. You're not trying to win through overwhelming force—you're winning through asymmetric trades and unconventional tactics.

The key strength of Yin is value calculation. One destroyer (1 resource) kamikaze-killing one dreadnought (4 resources) is a +3 resource advantage even though you "lost" the destroyer. Understanding this math—when to sacrifice units for maximum value—separates good Yin players from great ones.

Opponents will underestimate your kamikaze threat until you delete their capital ships with cheap destroyers. That moment when your 2-resource investment kills their 8-resource flagship? Pure efficiency.

## III. The Basics

### A. Home System & Commodities

**Home System:** Darien (4 resources / 4 influence = 4 optimal resources / 4 optimal influence)

**Commodities:** 2

**Notes:** Perfectly balanced home system with 4/4 split. The 4 resources fund your destroyer production, while 4 influence enables Indoctrination uses. Single-planet home system is easier to defend than multi-planet systems.

### B. Starting Fleet

- 2 Carriers
- 1 Destroyer
- 4 Fighters
- 4 Infantry
- 1 Space Dock

**Notes:** Solid starting fleet with 2 carriers for massive capacity (8 total). The 4 infantry and dual carriers give you excellent R1 expansion capability. Your starting destroyer can be used for early kamikaze demonstrations.

### C. Faction Abilities

**Devotion (Faction Ability):** After each space battle round, you may destroy 1 of your cruisers or destroyers in the active system to produce 1 hit and assign it to 1 of your opponent's ships in that system.

Your signature kamikaze ability. After each combat round (after both players roll dice), you may sacrifice a destroyer/cruiser to deal one guaranteed hit to any enemy ship. This is ABSURDLY powerful when used correctly. Trade cheap ships (destroyers = 1 resource) for expensive ships (dreadnoughts = 4 resources, flagships = 8 resources).

**Indoctrination (Faction Ability):** At the start of a ground combat, you may spend 2 influence to replace 1 of your opponent's participating infantry with 1 infantry from your reinforcements.

Planet-stealing ability. Before ground combat begins, spend 2 influence to convert one enemy infantry to yours. This swings combat math dramatically—if they had 2 infantry and you had 1, after Indoctrination it's 2 vs 1 in YOUR favor. Excellent for conquering lightly defended planets.

### D. Starting and Faction Technologies

**Starting Technologies:**

**Sarween Tools** - When you use PRODUCTION, reduce the combined cost of produced units by 1.

**Notes:** One of the best starting techs in the game. Sarween gives you immediate economic efficiency—every production saves 1 resource. Over a game, this saves 15-25 resources. Perfect for your destroyer-spam strategy (destroyers cost 1, Sarween makes them effectively 0 when producing 2+).

**Faction Technologies:**

**Yin Spinner (GG):**
*After you produce units, place up to 2 infantry from your reinforcements on any planet you control or in any space area that contains 1 or more of your ships.*

Infantry spawn tech. After producing, place up to 2 free infantry anywhere you have planets or ships. Incredible for rapid ground force deployment and invasions.

**Impulse Core (YY):**
*At the start of a space combat, you may destroy 1 of your cruisers or destroyers in the active system to produce 1 hit against your opponent's ships; that hit must be assigned by your opponent to 1 of his non-fighter ships if able.*

Pre-combat kamikaze tech. Before combat begins, sacrifice a destroyer/cruiser to deal 1 hit that MUST go to a non-fighter ship. This is Devotion but happens before combat starts, guaranteeing you kill a valuable ship before dice are rolled.

### E. Leaders

**Agent - Brother Milor:** *Codex 3 Version*

After a player's unit is destroyed: You may exhaust this card to allow that player to place 2 fighters in the destroyed unit's system if it was a ship, or 2 infantry if it was a ground force.

Interesting support agent. When any player (including you or opponents) loses a unit, you can exhaust this to let them spawn 2 fighters (if ship) or 2 infantry (if ground force). Primarily a trading/political tool—"I'll Agent you after your units die if you vote my way."

**Commander - Brother Omar:** *Codex 3 Version* *Unlock: Use one of your faction abilities.*

This card satisfies a green technology prerequisite. When you research a tech owned by another player, you may return 1 of your infantry to reinforcements to ignore its prerequisites.

Very easy unlock (just use Devotion or Indoctrination once). Provides a green prerequisite (useful for tech paths) AND lets you copy opponent faction techs by sacrificing infantry instead of meeting prerequisites. Situationally powerful for stealing strong faction techs like L1Z1X's Harrow or Jol-Nar's E-Res Siphons.

**Hero - Dannel of the Tenth:** *Codex 3 Version* *Unlock: Have 3 scored objectives.* **ACTION:** Commit up to 3 infantry from your reinforcements to any non-home planets and resolve invasions on those planets; players cannot use SPACE CANNON against those units.

Devastating invasion hero. Drop 3 infantry from nowhere onto any non-home planets, resolve invasions immediately, and opponents can't use SPACE CANNON to stop you. Use this R4-R5 to steal 3 lightly-defended planets instantly (legendary planets, equidistant planets, or Mecatol Rex if weakly garrisoned).

### F. Promissory Note - **Greyfire Mutagen**

At the start of a ground combat against 2 or more ground forces that are not controlled by the Yin player: Replace 1 of your opponent's infantry with 1 infantry from your reinforcements. Then, return this card to the Yin player.

Your promissory note is effectively Indoctrination for another player. They can use it once to convert an enemy infantry before ground combat. Trade value: 2-3 TG. Works best for aggressive factions (Nekro, Cabal) who invade frequently.

### G. Alliance

When you produce ships, you may produce 1 additional fighter or infantry for its cost.

Standard production bonus. Useful for economic factions. Trade value: 3-4 TG or equivalent.

### H. Mech - **Moyin's Ashes**

Cost: 2 | Combat: 6 | **Sustain Damage**

**DEPLOY:** When you use your Indoctrination faction ability, you may spend 1 additional influence to replace your opponent's unit with 1 mech instead of 1 infantry.

Powerful DEPLOY synergy. Normally Indoctrination converts 1 enemy infantry to yours for 2 influence. With this mech ability, spend 3 influence total (2 for Indoctrination + 1 for DEPLOY) to place a mech instead of infantry. This gives you Sustain Damage ground force instantly during invasion—excellent for conquering well-defended planets.

### I. Flagship - **Van Hauge**

Cost: 8 | Combat: 9 (x2) | Move: 1 | Capacity: 3 | **Sustain Damage**

When this ship is destroyed, destroy all ships in this system.

Nuclear flagship. When Van Hauge dies, it takes ALL ships in the system with it (yours AND opponents'). This is simultaneously amazing and dangerous. Use strategically—if you're losing a space battle, let your flagship die last and delete the entire enemy fleet. Opponents will be terrified to kill your flagship (mutually assured destruction).

### J. Breakthrough - **Yin Ascendant (Y<>G)**

When you gain this card or score a public objective, gain the alliance ability of a random, unused faction.

**Y<>G Synergy:** Yellow and green technologies count as each other for prerequisites.

**Ability:** Every time you score a public objective, you gain a random Alliance ability from unused factions. Over a game, you'll gain 5-6 Alliance abilities—this is massive power scaling. You effectively have 6 faction commanders by endgame.

**Y<>G synergy:** Sarween Tools (Y) counts as green, opening green tech paths. Very flexible tech progression.

**Note:** The random nature makes this inconsistent, but the sheer volume of alliances (5-6 over a game) guarantees strong value.

### K. Slice and Draft Considerations

Yin is flexible and can adapt to most slices. Your priorities:

**Speaker Order:**
- **Prefer positions 2-4** - Lets you grab Trade or Leadership early for expansion economy.
- **Avoid last position** - You want strategy card flexibility R1.

**Slice Priorities:**
- **Balanced resources/influence** - Your 4/4 home makes you flexible. Look for slices with 50/50 resource/influence split.
- **High planet count** - More planets = more targets for Indoctrination invasions and Yin Spinner spawns.
- **Tech skips (yellow/green ideal)** - Yellow skip accelerates into blue tech, green skip speeds Yin Spinner.
- **Avoid isolated slices** - You need access to neighbors for aggressive kamikaze trades.

**Slice Features to Avoid:**
- **Influence-starved slices** - You need influence for Indoctrination (2 per use). Don't go below 8-10 total influence.
- **Low planet count** - Reduces your Indoctrination targets and Yin Spinner spawn opportunities.

**Summary:**
Yin wants balanced economics (resources for destroyers, influence for Indoctrination), planet count for expansion, and neighbor access for kamikaze opportunities. Your flexible tech path (Sarween + Y<>G synergy) means tech skips are helpful but not mandatory.

## IV. Structural Weaknesses

### A. First Turn Priorities

**Round 1 Priority Rankings:**

1. **Expansion + Production** - Expand to 3-4 systems using your 2 carriers (capacity 8 total), 1 destroyer, and 4 infantry. Dual carriers allow splitting forces—send one carrier to distant systems, another for closer expansion. Build destroyers using Indoctrination (convert fighters to destroyers) for cheap fleet expansion.

2. **Technology** - Begin tech path toward Yin Spinner (GGY - upgraded flagship) or blue mobility (Gravity Drive). Destroyer II synergizes with kamikaze tactics. Early tech acceleration supports your R4-R5 power spike.

3. **Scoring** - Acceptable R1 for combat/expansion objectives. Your kamikaze ability makes combat-based objectives easier. However, your strength is mid-game Commander unlock (R2-R3) and Yin Spinner domination (R4-R5).

4. **Breakthrough** - Not a priority R1. Focus on Yin Spinner faction tech and unit upgrades (Destroyer II, Carrier II) before pursuing breakthrough technologies. Your kamikaze tactics require fleet saturation first.

**Expansion Notes:** You have 2 carriers (capacity 8 total), 1 destroyer, and 4 infantry. This gives you excellent R1 expansion capability. Aim for 3-4 systems R1. Your dual carriers let you split forces effectively—send one carrier with 2 infantry to distant systems, keep the other for closer expansion.

Your Commander unlock is trivial (just use Devotion or Indoctrination once), so aim to unlock R1-R2 through aggressive play.

### B. Kamikaze Math Dependency

Your power level depends entirely on correct kamikaze evaluation. Bad Yin players kamikaze randomly. Good Yin players calculate exact value trades—only kamikaze when trading down in cost but up in value (2:1 resource ratio minimum).

**Mitigation:** Learn kamikaze math (section V.C). Practice identifying profitable trades. Never kamikaze for marginal gains.

### C. Influence Scarcity

Indoctrination costs 2 influence per use. With only 4 influence at home, you can use it 2 times per round maximum (if you refresh planets). Budget Indoctrination carefully—use it 2-4 times per game on high-value targets only.

**Mitigation:** Expand to influence-heavy planets. Prioritize cultural planets (usually high influence). Don't waste Indoctrination on low-value targets.

### D. Flagship Double-Edged Sword

Your flagship destroys ALL ships when it dies (yours AND theirs). If you have valuable ships in the system when flagship dies, you lose them too. Requires careful positioning—keep flagship separate from your main fleet until you want to use its "nuke" ability.

**Mitigation:** Use flagship as a defensive deterrent ("Don't attack here or we both lose everything") or offensive finisher ("I'm losing this battle anyway, so I'll nuke your fleet with me").

## V. Technology

### A. Overview

You start with **Sarween Tools (Yellow)** (reduce production costs by 1).

Your main tech path focuses on Yin Spinner (GG) for infantry spam, blue techs for mobility, or red techs for unit upgrades depending on slice and strategy.

### B. Tech Path 1: Yin Spinner Focus (Standard)

**Starting Tech:** Sarween Tools

**Round 1: Neural Motivator OR Psychoarchaeology**
- **Neural Motivator:** You have +2 starting command counters
  - **Why:** More CCs for kamikaze aggression and expansion. Provides green prerequisite for Yin Spinner.
  - **Prerequisites:** None (0)
- **Psychoarchaeology:** When you resolve the primary or secondary ability of the Politics or Imperial strategy card, you may draw 1 action card
  - **Why:** Action card draw for political leverage.
  - **Prerequisites:** None (0)

**Round 2: Yin Spinner (GG)**
- After you produce units, place up to 2 infantry from your reinforcements on any planet you control or in any space area that contains 1 or more of your ships
- **Why:** Your faction tech. Spawn 2 infantry anywhere after every production. Over a game, this is 20-30 free infantry (10-15 resources saved). Enables constant invasions and objective scoring.
- **Prerequisites:** 2 green (Sarween with Y<>G + Neural Motivator OR green skip)

**Round 3: Gravity Drive (B)**
- After you activate a system, apply +1 to the move value of 1 of your ships during this tactical action
- **Why:** Mobility for kamikaze strikes and rapid repositioning. Essential for reaching distant targets.
- **Prerequisites:** 1 blue

**Round 4: Destroyer II (RR) OR Carrier II (BB)**
- **Destroyer II:** Cost 1 | Combat 8 | Move 2 | ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE 6 (x3)
  - **Prerequisites:** 2 red
  - **Why:** Better kamikaze destroyers with AFB. Cheaper to sacrifice, more effective before dying.
- **Carrier II:** Cost 3 | Combat 9 | Move 2 | Capacity 6
  - **Prerequisites:** 2 blue
  - **Why:** Transport 6 units (including Yin Spinner infantry). Essential for mass invasions.

**Round 5+:** Flex based on objectives (Fleet Logistics, Cruiser II, etc.)

**Tech Requirements:**
- **Green skip (very helpful):** Enables Yin Spinner R2 with just Sarween
- **Blue skip (helpful):** Accelerates Gravity Drive
- **Yellow skip (bonus):** Opens yellow tech options

**Pros:**
- Early Yin Spinner (R2) for constant infantry spam
- Balanced mobility (Gravity Drive)
- Economic efficiency (Sarween + Yin Spinner = free units)
- Scales into late game (more production = more Yin Spinner procs)

**Cons:**
- Delayed unit upgrades (Destroyer II R4)
- Requires green prerequisite investment

**Best For:** Most games. Yin Spinner is your faction identity—spawn infantry everywhere, invade constantly, use Indoctrination to convert defenders.

---

### C. Tech Path 2: Blue Mobility (Alternative)

**Starting Tech:** Sarween Tools

**Round 1: Gravity Drive (B) - WITH BLUE SKIP**
- After you activate a system, apply +1 to the move value of 1 of your ships during this tactical action
- **Prerequisites:** 1 blue (with blue skip)
- **Why:** Early mobility for kamikaze strikes across the map. Hit-and-run destroyer attacks.

**Round 2: Destroyer II (RR)**
- Cost 1 | Combat 8 | Move 2 | ANTI-FIGHTER BARRAGE 6 (x3)
- **Prerequisites:** 2 red
- **Why:** Upgraded kamikaze destroyers. Move 2 + Gravity Drive = move 3 reach. Strike anywhere.

**Round 3: Fleet Logistics (BB)**
- During each of your turns in the action phase, you may perform 2 actions instead of 1
- **Prerequisites:** 2 blue
- **Why:** Double activations enable kamikaze + invasion combos in one turn.

**Round 4: Carrier II (BB)**
- Cost 3 | Combat 9 | Move 2 | Capacity 6
- **Prerequisites:** 2 blue
- **Why:** Transport armies for invasions.

**Round 5+:** Yin Spinner (GG) or other flex techs

**Tech Requirements:**
- **Blue skip (key):** Enables Gravity Drive R1
- **Red skip (helpful):** Accelerates Destroyer II
- **Green skip (bonus):** Speeds Yin Spinner late

**Pros:**
- Early mobility (Gravity Drive R1)
- Fast destroyer upgrades (R2)
- Fleet Logistics R3 for double actions
- Kamikaze strikes anywhere on map

**Cons:**
- Delays Yin Spinner (your best tech) until R5
- More military-focused, less economic

**Best For:** Aggressive slices with weak neighbors. Hit-and-run kamikaze attacks, conquer planets before they can reinforce.

### D. Kamikaze Math & Devotion Strategy

**Core Principle:** Only kamikaze when you trade DOWN in cost but UP in value (minimum 2:1 ratio).

**Good Kamikazes:**
- Destroyer (1 resource) → Kill Dreadnought (4 resources) = +3 advantage ✅
- Destroyer (1 resource) → Kill Carrier with 4 infantry (3 + 2 resources) = +4 advantage ✅
- Cruiser (2 resources) → Kill Flagship (8 resources) = +6 advantage ✅
- Destroyer (1 resource) → Kill Cruiser (2 resources) = +1 advantage ✅ (acceptable)

**Bad Kamikazes:**
- Destroyer (1 resource) → Kill Fighter (0.5 resources) = -0.5 advantage ❌
- Cruiser (2 resources) → Kill Destroyer (1 resource) = -1 advantage ❌
- Destroyer (1 resource) → Kill Destroyer (1 resource) = 0 advantage ❌ (neutral, usually skip)

**Targeting Priority:**
1. **Expensive capital ships** (Dreadnoughts, Carriers, Flagships, War Suns)
2. **Carriers with units inside** (killing carrier strands infantry in space—they die)
3. **Ships that used Sustain Damage** (finish them off before they repair)
4. **Ships about to deal damage** (remove their hits before next combat round)

**Example Combat:**
- Opponent: 2 Dreadnoughts, 1 Carrier (with 4 infantry), 3 Fighters
- You: 5 Destroyers, 1 Carrier
- **Combat Round 1:**
  - Both sides roll dice
  - After rolls, Devotion triggers:
    - Kamikaze Destroyer 1 → Kill Dreadnought A (trade 1 for 4)
    - Kamikaze Destroyer 2 → Kill Dreadnought B (trade 1 for 4)
    - Kamikaze Destroyer 3 → Kill Carrier (trade 1 for 3, plus 4 infantry die)
  - **Result:** You lost 3 destroyers (3 resources), killed 2 dreads + carrier + 4 infantry (15 resources). +12 advantage.

**Devotion Timing:**
Devotion triggers AFTER each space battle round (after both players roll, assign hits, and use Sustain Damage). This means:
- You see opponent's rolls before deciding to kamikaze
- You can kamikaze to finish wounded ships (opponent used Sustain, you kamikaze to kill it)
- You can kamikaze multiple times per combat (once per round)

---

## VI. Strategy Cards

### A. Round 1

Your R1 priority is economy and expansion for early aggression.

**Round 1 Priority Ranking:**

1. **Trade** - You have 2 commodities and need economy for destroyer production.

2. **Leadership** - Command counters for expansion and kamikaze aggression.

3. **Technology** - Tech progression toward Yin Spinner or Destroyer II.

4. **Warfare** - Enables aggressive R1-R2 plays with fleet redistribution.

5. **Politics** - Speaker for political control (less critical for Yin).

6. **Construction** - Forward dock is fine but not urgent R1.

7. **Diplomacy** - Defensive tool but you're aggressive, not defensive.

8. **Imperial** - Never R1.

### B. Round 2+

**Love:**
- **Trade** - Refresh 2 commodities for destroyer production. Need constant economy.
- **Leadership** - Command counters for kamikaze aggression, expansion, and Yin Spinner spawns.
- **Warfare** - Redistribution after kamikaze attacks. Unlock sacrificed fleets for reinforcement.

**Good:**
- **Technology** - Stay on tech path toward Yin Spinner and unit upgrades.
- **Imperial** - Needed for scoring R3-R5.
- **Politics** - Agenda control and speaker token.

**Situational:**
- **Construction** - Only if needing forward docks or structure objectives.
- **Diplomacy** - Rarely useful for aggressive Yin.

---

## VII. Intermediate

### A. Unit Composition

Your ideal fleet composition in each system:

- **5-8 Destroyers** - Core kamikaze fleet. Build these constantly (cost 1 with Sarween = effectively 0).
- **1-2 Carriers** - Transport capacity for Yin Spinner infantry.
- **1 Cruiser (optional)** - Alternative kamikaze target (cost 2, can be sacrificed if needed).
- **Infantry (6-10)** - Yin Spinner spawns 2 per production. Build massive armies.
- **1-2 Mechs (optional)** - Deploy via Indoctrination for Sustain Damage ground forces.

Your strategy is destroyer spam + infantry spam. Destroyers for kamikaze strikes, infantry for invasions via Yin Spinner. Avoid expensive ships (dreadnoughts, flagships) until late game—you're built for cheap, expendable units.

**Kamikaze Fleet Cycling:**
R2: Build 8 destroyers → R3: Kamikaze 4 destroyers → R4: Rebuild 8 destroyers → R5: Kamikaze again

### C. Game Plan

**Strategic Approach:**

**Rounds 1-2: Build Destroyer Swarm & Unlock Commander**
- Take Trade or Leadership R1
- Build 8-10 destroyers by R2
- Use Devotion once R1-R2 to unlock Commander (trivial)
- Research Yin Spinner R2 (if going standard path)

**Rounds 3-4: Kamikaze Aggression & Yin Spinner Invasions**
- Kamikaze 3-5 destroyers R3-4 targeting expensive capital ships
- Use Yin Spinner after every production to spawn 2 infantry anywhere
- Invade lightly-defended planets using Indoctrination (convert defenders)
- Commander's green prerequisite enables tech flexibility (copy faction techs if valuable)

**Round 5: Hero Invasions & Final Push**
- Hero R5: Drop 3 infantry onto 3 key planets (legendary planets, Mecatol Rex, or objective planets)
- Kamikaze remaining destroyers in critical battles
- Use Yin Ascendant alliances (5-6 by now) for massive power spike
- Score final objectives via Yin Spinner ground force saturation

**Key Strategic Principles:**
1. **Spam destroyers** - Build 10-15 total over the game, kamikaze 5-8 of them
2. **Kamikaze math** - Only sacrifice when 2:1+ resource advantage
3. **Yin Spinner procs** - Produce in 3-4 systems per round to spawn 6-8 infantry per round
4. **Indoctrination targets** - Use on 2-4 high-value planets (legendary, Mecatol Rex, or key objectives)
5. **Hero timing** - R5 for 3 simultaneous invasions without SPACE CANNON risk

---

## VIII. Objectives

### A. Objective Summary

**Strengths:** Yin excels at fleet composition objectives with destroyer spam naturally achieving armada requirements. Spending objectives are easy with 4/4 balanced home economy, and combat objectives benefit from Devotion guaranteed hits.

**Weaknesses:** Structure objectives are challenging without natural building focus. Tech diversity objectives require investment, and peaceful objectives contradict your aggressive kamikaze playstyle requiring combat for maximum efficiency.

### B. Stage I Objectives

**Notes:**
- **Destroy their Greatest Ship** is EASY for Yin—kamikaze a destroyer to kill any flagship/war sun
- **Mechanize the Military** and **Occupy the Fringe** are EASY due to Yin Spinner spawning infantry everywhere
- **Demonstrate your Power** is EASY after kamikaze fights (your remaining destroyers count)
- Combat-heavy secrets strongly favor Yin

**Legend:** 🟢 Likely | 🟡 Possible | 🔴 Difficult

- **Found a Golden Age** and **Galvanize the People** are EASY (resource-heavy economy, constant CC usage)
- Yin struggles with structure objectives and tech diversity objectives

## IX. Alliance Priority

Trading for other factions' Alliance promissory notes (which give you access to their Commanders) can significantly boost your strategy. Here are the top alliances to prioritize:

**Super Top Tier:**
1. **Titans of Ul (Tungstantus)** - When you use PRODUCTION, gain 1 trade good. Perfect for destroyer spam. You produce 10-15 times per game = 10-15 TG.
2. **Nomad (Navarch Feng)** - Produce your flagship without spending resources. Saves 8 resources for destroyer production.
3. **Sardakk N'orr (G'hom Sek'kus)** - During Commit Ground Forces step, commit 1 ground force from each planet in active/adjacent systems. Synergizes with Yin Spinner infantry everywhere.
4. **Muaat (Magmus)** - After you spend token from strategy pool, gain 1 trade good. You spend CCs constantly = constant TG income.

**Really Useful:**
5. **Hacan (Carth of Golden Sands)** - After you roll dice for combat, SPACE CANNON, or AFB, reroll any number. Useful for rerolling bad kamikaze combat rounds.
6. **L1Z1X (Il Na Viroset)** - During tactical actions, you can activate systems with your command tokens and return both tokens. Useful for recycling kamikaze systems.
7. **Jol-Nar (Ta Zern)** - When units use PRODUCTION, AFB, BOMBARDMENT, or SPACE CANNON, reroll any dice. Boosts your production and destroyer AFB.
8. **Empyrean (Xuange)** - After player moves ships into system with your tokens, return token. Recycles kamikaze system activations.

## XI. End Notes

Yin Brotherhood is a mid-tier faction with unique kamikaze mechanics and unconventional strategies. Your job is to:

1. **Master kamikaze math** - Only sacrifice when 2:1+ resource advantage (destroyer killing dreadnought = good)
2. **Spam destroyers** - Build 10-15 over the game, kamikaze 5-8 of them
3. **Research Yin Spinner R2** - Spawn 2 infantry after every production (20-30 free infantry over game)
4. **Use Indoctrination strategically** - 2-4 times per game on high-value planets (Mecatol Rex, legendary planets)
5. **Unlock Commander R1-R2** - Use Devotion once (trivial unlock)
6. **Hero R5** - Drop 3 infantry onto 3 key planets for instant invasions
7. **Leverage Yin Ascendant** - Gain 5-6 random Alliance abilities by endgame for massive power scaling

Don't let anyone tell you kamikaze is wasteful. You're trading cheap ships for expensive ships—that's efficiency. Play the math correctly, understand when to sacrifice for value, and dominate through asymmetric warfare.

**FOR THE BROTHERHOOD. DEATH FUELS VICTORY.**
